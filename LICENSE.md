This program and supporting templates and css are released under a do whatever the heck you like with it license.

I'd say that applies to its output, too, but I don't own the input.

So I'll just say that I take no position on you doing whatever the heck you like with the output, including modifying it, reposting it without credit, or folding, spindling, and mutilating it.
