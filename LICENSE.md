This program and supporting templates and css are released under a do whatever the heck you like with it license. Feel free to modify, redistribute without including this license notice or credit, even sell it (good luck with that).

I'd say that applies to its output, too, but I don't own the input.

So I'll just say that I take no position on you doing whatever the heck you like with the output, including modifying it, redstributing it, or folding, spindling, and mutilating it.
