        Have you tried:<br>
        <br>
          reading the theater marquee before delivering the envelope?<br>
          listening to the conch shell before delivering the envelope?<br>
          examining the video game in Festeron? In Witchville?<br>
          opening the metal can inside the Magick Shoppe?<br>
          examining the wanted posters in Festeron? In Witchville?<br>
          staying in the Jail Cell after being captured by the Boot Patrol?<br>
          getting captured three times by the Boot Patrol, after saving the<br>
            seahorse? Without saving the seahorse?<br>
          ignoring King Anatinus? Dropping the whistle or the hat?<br>
          letting the small mailbox meet the big mailbox?<br>
          looking around the Museum after the mailboxes have met? If the mailboxes<br>
            never met?<br>
          leaving things in either mailbox, letting the boxes meet, and looking<br>
            inside the fossil afterward?<br>
          putting things inside the wizard&#39;s hat? And finishing the story?<br>
          dropping the lighted candle into the bay, lake or river?<br>
          wishing for freedom while Mr. Crisp is watching?<br>
          pushing the lever on the torture machine UP while the Princess was clamped<br>
            inside?<br>
          putting interesting objects (like the black cat) into the torture machine,<br>
            and pushing the lever up?<br>
          torturing the Princess and the black cat at the same time?<br>
          pouring out the grue&#39;s milk near the black cat? Near Chaos?<br>
          putting on the 3D glasses just before you put the stone into the<br>
            sculpture? And then NOT putting it in?<br>
          giving the stone to the old woman in the Museum?<br>
