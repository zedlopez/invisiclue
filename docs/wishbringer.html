  <h2>Festeron</h2>
      <p>Somebody inside the Post Office is calling me. What should I do?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The Post Office door may give you a clue. EXAMINE it.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Since the door is open, why not GO INSIDE and see who&#039;s calling?</details>
      <p>Where is the Magick Stone?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>That&#039;s for us to know, and for you to find out.</details>
      <p>Who is Mr. Crisp?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>He&#039;s your mean old boss.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>And he isn&#039;t very happy about your idle daydreaming.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>So you&#039;d better do what he says.</details>
      <p>When should I open the envelope that came in my WIHBRINGER package?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The story will tell you.  Patience!</details>
      <p>How do I get into the cemetery?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>WALK INTO THE CEMETERY.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>You&#039;re not going to let the computer scare you away, are you?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Go on, chicken! WALK INTO THE CEMETERY and answer YES to the question.</details>
      <p>Who is the gravedigger?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>LOOK AT THE GRAVEDIGGER and find out.</details>
      <p>How do I get the flowers out of the hearse?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Did you find the vase?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>It may be hidden amongst the flowers in the hearse.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>There aren&#039;t any flowers in the hearse.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>There&#039;s no hearse or vase, either.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Remember the warning in the introduction: Don&#039;t let the presence or</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>absence of questions, or the length of the answers, influence the way</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>you play.</details>
      <p>What should I do with the umbrella?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It might come in handy if it rains.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>You can&#039;t WISH FOR RAIN unless you have an umbrella.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>So maybe you should hold onto it for later.</details>
      <p>How do I get through the locked gate in the Twilight Glen?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The gravedigger has the only key to the gate.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>But the gravedigger is nowhere to be seen.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>You can&#039;t unlock the gate. To leave the cemetery, you must go out</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>through the open gate at Creepy Corner.</details>
      <p>Why won&#039;t the poodle let me near the cottage?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It wouldn&#039;t be much of a watchdog if it did, would it?</details>
      <p>Why won&#039;t the poodle let me go north, into the village?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It doesn&#039;t like people walking past the cottage.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>It doesn&#039;t like mail clerks.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>It doesn&#039;t like you.</details>
      <p>How do I get past the poodle?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>I wouldn&#039;t PICK UP THE POODLE THEN KICK IT if I were you.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Since violence doesn&#039;t work, maybe bribery will.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>You&#039;ll have to find something to bribe it with.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Have you been to every location you can visit without getting past the</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>poodle?</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Have you looked all around the cemetery?</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>Have you investigated the open grave in the Spooky Copse?</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>The gravedigger won&#039;t let you into the grave while he&#039;s watching.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>Wait until the gravedigger goes away. Then GO INTO THE OPEN GRAVE. PICK</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>UP THE OLD BONE. Bring it to the poodle and FEED THE BONE TO THE</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>POODLE. Now you can GO NORTH into the village.</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>I left the envelope behind, and the poodle won&#039;t let me go back for it! What</details>
      <p>can I do?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You&#039;re not a very good mail clerk, are you?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>There&#039;s no way to walk past the poodle once it has finished eating the</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>bone.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>So you&#039;ll have to start all over again.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>RESTART. Next time, hold on to that envelope!</details>
      <p>Who is Miss Voss?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>She&#039;s in charge of the Festeron Town Library, curator of the Festeron</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Historical Museum, and author of the best-selling &quot;Local History</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Series&quot; of booklets, including _The Legend of Wishbringer_.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Aren&#039;t you glad you asked?</details>
      <p>Why won&#039;t Miss Voss give me back my library card?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>She doesn&#039;t like mail clerks.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>She doesn&#039;t like you.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>What library card?</details>
      <p>What should I do with the violet note?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Miss Voss asked you to give it to your boss, Mr. Crisp.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>But delivering the mysterious envelope is more important right now.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>So give the note to Mr. Crisp after you deliver the envelope.</details>
      <p>Who is &quot;Corky&quot;?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It might be the name of Miss Voss&#039;s poodle.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>But why would Miss Voss write a note to her dog?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Since Miss Voss asked you to give the note to Mr. Crisp, and the note</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>is addressed to &quot;Corky,&quot; it&#039;s probably Mr. Crisp&#039;s nickname.</details>
      <p>How do I get inside the Library?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Miss Voss probably has the key.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Unfortunately, Miss Voss isn&#039;t around any more.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>You don&#039;t have time to fool around in the Library right now. The</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Magick Shoppe closes at five o&#039;clock!</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Be patient; maybe you can get inside after you deliver the envelope.</details>
      <p>Who is Sgt. MacGuffin?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>He&#039;s in charge of Festeron&#039;s Police Department.</details>
      <p>How do I get the chcolate?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Simply TAKE THE CHOCOLATE OFF THE DESK.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Of course, Sgt. MacGuffin might have other ideas.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Have you tried examining Sgt. MacGuffin?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Wait until Sgt. MacGuffin falls asleep before taking the chocolate.</details>
      <p>What should I do in the Park?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The statue in the middle of the fountain is interesting.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>But not as interesting as the other objects in the fountain.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>LOOK INSIDE THE FOUNTAIN.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>The rest is up to you.</details>
      <p>How do I catch the goldfish?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Unfortunately, you won&#039;t find a net or pole anywhere.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>What makes you think you have to catch the goldfish?</details>
      <p>The movie theater is closed! How do I get inside?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The schedule might give you a hint.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>The theater opens at seven o&#039;clock. Come back later.</details>
      <p>Why can&#039;t I take things out of the big mailbox?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Public mailboxes are built to discourage prying fingers like yours.</details>
      <p>How do I play the video game?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>By scoring as many points as you can.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Naturally, you&#039;ll have to put a token in the video machine before you</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>can play.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Isn&#039;t it getting awfully close to five o&#039;clock?</details>
      <p>What do I do with the seahorse?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>If you don&#039;t do something quickly, it will probably die.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>A seahorse can&#039;t live long out of water.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>PICK UP THE SEAHORSE THEN THROW IT INTO THE BAY.</details>
      <p>What happened to the church mouse?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It ran away when it saw you. Surprised?</details>
      <p>How do I get the candle?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Try to TAKE THE CANDLE.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Try to STEAL THE CANDLE.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Taking things that don&#039;t belong to you is stealing, especially in a</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>church.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>At the moment, you can&#039;t steal the candle.</details>
      <p>What should I do with the pile of leaves?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Did you notice the message in the sand near the leaves?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Are you going to do what the message says?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>You might be sorry if you don&#039;t.</details>
      <p>Who wrote the message in the sand?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The person who wrote the message was obviously very concerned that</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>somebody like you might come along and disturb the pile of leaves.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Aside from this acute observation, the author of the message is not</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>important.</details>
      <p>How do I get to Misty Island?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>If you had a bathing suit you could put it on and swim over.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>No bathing suit, eh? Oh, well. You&#039;ll just have to wait for the Misty</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Island ferry.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Charter a private seaplane, preferably one equipped with a wet bar and</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>jacuzzi.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>If all else fails, give up.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>But watch for new opportunities after you deliver the envelope.</details>
      <p>What do I do with the horseshoe?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Keep it. It might bring you good luck.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Especially if you use it to WISH FOR LUCK after you find the Magick</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Stone.</details>
      <p>How do I get into the lighthouse?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It&#039;s a phoney lighthouse. You can&#039;t go into it.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Ever.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>So stop trying.</details>
      <p>What should I feed to the pelican?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>A flapping, juicy fish would be nice if you can find one.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>The only fish you&#039;ll find is in the fountain.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Unfortunately, you can&#039;t get the fish in the fountain.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>What makes you think the pelican is hungry?</details>
      <p>What&#039;s the easiest way into the impenetrable forest?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Look up the word &quot;impenetrable&quot; in a dictionary.</details>
      <p>What can I do with the gnarled, rotten tree?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You can always CLIMB THE GNARLED TREE.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Maybe you should have examined the tree first.</details>
      <p>What can I do with the dead branch?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It probably won&#039;t help you deliver the envelope any faster.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>But it&#039;s a good idea to remember where it is. You might find a use for</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>it later.</details>
      <p>Mr. Crisp just fired me! What did I do wrong?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You failed to deliver the envelope on time, or didn&#039;t read it to the</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>old woman. Next time, make sure you&#039;re in the Magick Shoppe before five</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>o&#039;clock, and do what the old woman asks you to do!</details>
<!-- Ye Olde Magick Shoppe -->
  <h2 id="ye_olde_magick_shoppe">Ye Olde Magick Shoppe</h2>
      <p>Why is &quot;Magick&quot; spelled with a &quot;k&quot;?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Because.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Oh, all right. &quot;Magick&quot; is an archaic spelling popularized by Aleister</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Crowley (a 20th century occultist) and occasionally seen in pulp</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>fantasies and tales of horror. It&#039;s supposed to imply an especially old</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>and potent variety of supernatural force.</details>
      <p>How do I get into the Magick Shoppe?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Just OPEN THE DOOR THEN GO INSIDE.</details>
      <p>A gust of wind blew the door shut! How do I open it again?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You can&#039;t open it by yourself.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Relax. Maybe somebody will come along and open it for you.</details>
      <p>How do I take the naughty birthday cards?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>By removing them from the glass case.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Unfortunately, you can&#039;t reach into the glass case.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>So you can&#039;t take the naughty birthday cards.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>You rascal.</details>
      <p>Why can&#039;t I approach the curtain?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Maybe it doesn&#039;t like mail clerks.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>It&#039;s enchanted in such a way as to discourage nosey visitors.</details>
      <p>Who is the old woman?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>She&#039;s the proprietor of the Magick Shoppe.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>The mysterious envelope is addressed to her.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>So maybe you ought to give her the mysterious envelope.</details>
      <p>Why did the Shoppe become strangely quiet all of a sudden?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>A noise stopped.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>A nearby mechanism stopped working.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>EXAMINE THE GRANDFATHER CLOCK.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>The clock stopped when the old woman appeared. Creepy, isn&#039;t it?</details>
      <p>I found a bug! The clock on my status line stopped. Should I call Infocom?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It&#039;s not a bug. See the previous question for details.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>If it was a bug, you could blame it on one of the Infopeople who tested</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>the game. In alphabetical order, they are:</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>&quot;Hollywood&quot; Dave Anderson (Manager), Joanne Avtges, Gary Brennan, Amy</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Briggs, Mark &quot;Max&quot; Buxton, Liz Cyr-Jones, Suzanne Frank, Jeff O&#039;Neill,</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>plus dozens of beta- and gamma-testers too numerous to list.</details>
      <p>Who is &quot;The Evil One&quot;?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>She&#039;s the person who mailed the mysterious envelope.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>She kidnapped the old woman&#039;s pet cat and is demanding a Magick Stone</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>for ransom.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>If she doesn&#039;t get the Stone before the moon sets, she&#039;ll probably do</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>something awful to the cat.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Doesn&#039;t sound like a very nice person, does she?</details>
      <p>What should I do with the metal can?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Like all objects in the story, you should EXAMINE it.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>The rest is up to you.</details>
      <p>Why does the metal can rattle?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Maybe there are some yummy mixed nuts inside.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Then again, maybe not.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>There&#039;s something built into the can that makes it rattle. It&#039;s</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>designed to lure innocent victims to their doom by making them believe</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>there may be nuts inside.</details>
      <p>Why can&#039;t I move when the old woman touches my forehead?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>She&#039;s casting a subtle hypnotic spell on you.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>So shut up and pay attention.</details>
      <p>Who is &quot;Chaos&quot;?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It&#039;s the name of the old woman&#039;s pet cat.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>It&#039;s also the name of Dan Horn&#039;s pet skunk.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Who is Dan Horn?</details>

      <p>What happened to Festeron? Everything&#039;s changed! Exactly. The village seems to have come under an evil, supernatural influence. The influence&#039;s initials are T.E.O. The &quot;T&quot; stands for &quot;The&quot;, and the &quot;O&quot; stands for &quot;One&quot;. Sorry. You have to figure out the &quot;E&quot; yourself.</p>

      <p>How do I get into the tower?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Didn&#039;t King Anatinus say something about getting into the Tower?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>You need a Word of Power.</details>

      <p>How did the Princess get captured again?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>She isn&#039;t a very smart platypus, is she?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Help! Mr. Crisp is getting ready to torture me!</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>He&#039;s sleazy enough to take a bribe.</details>

        <details><summary>F.</summary>GIVE THE VIOLET NOTE TO MR. CRISP.</details>
      <p>Mr. Crisp is gone, but I&#039;m still in chains! What should I do?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>There are two ways to get out of the chains.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>One of them involves Magick.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>WISH FOR FREEDOM will work.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>But you wouldn&#039;t need Magick if you had the key to the chains.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Mr. Crisp dropped the key in his lab coat, remember?</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>He dropped the lab coat on the floor.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>PICK UP THE WHITE LAB COAT. TAKE THE KEY OUT OF THE COAT. UNLOCK THE</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>CHAINS WITH THE KEY.</details>
      <p>Where did Mr. Crisp go?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>He went to visit his sweetheart, Miss Voss.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>But who cares, as long as he isn&#039;t here to torture you?</details>
      <p>How do I free the Princess from the torture machine?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Just do what she says.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>PULL DOWN THE LEVER.</details>
      <p>How do I get out of the torture chamber?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The same way Mr. Crisp did.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>OPEN THE HATCH. CLIMB UP THE LADDER.</details>
      <p>What is the significance of the paintings in the Round Chamber?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The story they illustrate may sound vaguely familiar.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Especially if you read _The Legend of Wishbringer_.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>The paintings also conceal an important secret.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>LOOK BEHIND A PAINTING.</details>
      <p>The drawbridge is closed! How do I get out of the Tower?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Read the previous hint for clues.</details>
      <p>The suit of armor is chasing me! What should I do?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Hit it with the dead branch.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Throw the stone at it.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Light the grue&#039;s milk on fire with the candle, then give the milk to</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>the suit of armor to drink. It&#039;ll still chase you, but at least it will</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>be laughing.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>There is no suit of armor in this story.</details>
      <p>Why is the room above the Round Chamber all blurry?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Blurry, huh? Gee. Maybe you need glasses.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>PUT ON THE 3D GLASSES after you walk into the blurry room.</details>
      <p>What should I do with the telescope in the Laboratory?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You could ignore it. It&#039;s probably just a prop.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>The telescope is just a prop.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>So ignore it!</details>
      <p>What is the significance of the bubbling chemicals?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>They&#039;re not significant at all. Leave them alone.</details>
      <p>What is the purpose of the control panel?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It has two switches, so it probably controls two things.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Have you examined both of the switches?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>The first switch controls the power in the Palace Theater. (If you</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>watched the entire movie, you&#039;d already know this.)</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>The second switch controls the &quot;security&quot; for something. Hmm. Wonder</details>

        <details><summary>A.</summary>Wait until Miss Voss opens it tomorrow morning.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Unfortunately, you haven&#039;t got time to wait. Looks like you&#039;ll have to</details>

        <details><summary>B.</summary>to the Cliff Bottom.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>If you&#039;re at Edge of Lake, wishing for Rain will fill the narrow pit</details>

      <p>When should I WISH FOR FLIGHT?</p>

        <details><summary>L.</summary>The hellhound will eat you up if you hang around for more than three</details>
