        <details><summary>B.</summary>- He has only an inkpad.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- Maybe if you found him a rubber stamp, he would stop blubbering and help</details>

  <h2>Around the Grounds</h2>
      <p>How do I get inside the house?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- As the game begins, try walking east or west, then returning to the</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>south junction (by going south).</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- Hmmm. The statue&#039;s facing a different direction. Peculiar, eh?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- You can turn the statue so that the bazooka points in any compass</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>direction.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- Just like the dial on some kind of wacky combination lock.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>- If you could find the right combination of directions to turn the statue</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>in, you could unlock the front door.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>- Did you find any compass directions mentioned in any of the materials in</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>your game package?</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>- Look closely at the poem on the back of Uncle Buddy&#039;s photo.</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>- The poem prominently mentions three directions within various movie</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>titles.</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>- If you turn the statue in these directions, in order, the front door</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>will unlock with a click.</details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>Q.</summary>Is there anything I should do with the statue of Buck Palace, the fighting</details>
      <p>letter carrier?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Yes, Buck is very important.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Have you noticed you can turn Buck to point in different directions?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- Buck will help you get in the house. See the previous question if you</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>need more help.</details>
      <p>I can&#039;t get past the water buffalo in Charo&#039;s kitchen. What should I do?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Drink all the water in any pond.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Squeeze your nose with a garlic mincer.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- Swallow your hands.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- Go rollerskating in a nearby subway tunnel.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- Only develop the answers to questions on which you&#039;re really stumped.</details>
      <p>What should I do in the hedge maze?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- As you may have guessed, you&#039;ll need to get to a secret location within</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>the maze.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- The location of this spot is well-marked on a map of the maze.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- Have you found a piece of paper with lines on it?</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- If so, then you have a partial map of the maze. It shows the positions</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>of half of the hedge walls.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>- The X on the piece of paper shows where your destination in the hedge</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>maze is located.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>- By itself, the piece of paper is enough to go on; you can fill in the</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>other positions of the hedge walls by trial and error. This will require</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>a considerable amount of patience and map-making, though.</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>- If you&#039;d like to save time and effort, you&#039;ll find a second piece of</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>paper later in the story. It shows the locations of the other hedge</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>walls.</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>- If you PUT THE YELLOWED PIECE ON THE THIN PIECE, you&#039;ll be able to view</details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary>the whole hedge maze map.</details>
        <details><summary>Q.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>R.</summary>Hey, the secret location in the maze isn&#039;t any different from the other</details>
      <p>spots in the maze! What gives?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- The location is cosmetically the same as any other in the maze...</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- ...but looks aren&#039;t everything.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- What would a pirate do at the X on a treasure map? (No, I don&#039;t mean a</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>software pirate!)</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- Did you bring a shovel into the maze?</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- If so, typing DIG IN GROUND should uncover something different.</details>
      <p>How do I open the small compartment under the cannon?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- You&#039;ll have to move the cannon off of the compartment&#039;s lid first.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Like most cannons, however, this one is much too heavy for a person to</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>move.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- If you fired the cannon, the recoil might push it back a few feet.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- Especially if there was something heavy in the barrel.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- How about the cannon ball?</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>- TAKE THE CANNON BALL. PUT IT IN THE CANNON. LIGHT THE FUSE with any</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>source of fire. When the cannon fires, it will recoil, and move off of</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>the small compartment.</details>
      <p>Where can I find a source of fire?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- There&#039;s a match inside the mansion.</details>
      <p>How do I open the hatch at the cliff?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- You can&#039;t open it from above. You&#039;ll find a way to open it from below</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>later on in the story.</details>
      <p>Is there a way to get the ladder up the cliff face?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- It&#039;s a pretty heavy ladder.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- And such a steep cliff!</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- In short, no.</details>
      <p>How do I get across the gap in the beach stairs?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- If you haven&#039;t figured out how to get into the mansion, you won&#039;t be</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>able to cross the gap. Go on to something else for now.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- If you&#039;ve gotten into the house and explored a little of the first</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>floor, then this puzzle should be a downhill struggle.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- Snow what I mean?</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- The skis will help you across the gap.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>- Take the skis to the top landing and put them on. Then, just SKI DOWN</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>THE STAIRS. They&#039;ll carry you across the gap.</details>
<!-- First Floor -->
  <h2>First Floor</h2>
      <p>What should I do with the fireplace?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- If you haven&#039;t already done so, you may want to ENTER THE FIREPLACE.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Have you tried removing the loose brick?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- Good foothold, huh?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- Still stumped? Type UP.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Is there any significance to the painting of Uncle Buddy and Aunt</details>
      <p>Hildegarde?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Yes.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- It&#039;s rather moving, isn&#039;t it?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- You can look behind it.</details>
      <p>Oh! I found a wall safe! How do I open it?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- You&#039;ll have to find the right combination.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- The solution isn&#039;t exactly black and white.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- It&#039;s actually red, white and blue.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- Try examining the three wax statuettes.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- Each is holding up a certain number of fingers on a certain hand.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- TURN THE DIAL RIGHT TO 3. TURN IT LEFT TO 7. TURN IT RIGHT TO 5. OPEN</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>THE SAFE.</details>
      <p>What do I do in the closet?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Have you tried doing anything with the coat pegs?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Try typing PULL THE THIRD PEG.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- You&#039;re on the second floor now. The closet is really an elevator! (By</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>similar logic, pulling the first peg will bring the closet to the cellar</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>level, and pulling the second will take you back to the first floor.)</details>
      <p>Is there anything I can do with the sawed-off peg in the closet?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- If you don&#039;t understand how the closet works, don&#039;t go on. Develop the</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>clues in the question above this one.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- You can&#039;t actually do anything with the sawed-off peg.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- It&#039;s just a clue.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- It tells you that there must be another floor above the second story.</details>
      <p>Can I do anything with the hole to the left of the first peg?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- If you don&#039;t understand how the closet works, don&#039;t go on. Develop the</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>clues in the &quot;What do I do in the closet?&quot; question.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- Since there was once a peg in this hole, there must be a floor below the</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>cellar.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- There is a peg that will fit into this hole...</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- ...but don&#039;t waste valuable time looking for it. When the time is right,</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>you&#039;ll find the peg.</details>
      <p>What&#039;s the point of the model of downtown Tokyo?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- EXAMINE THE MODEL.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- This is a puzzle. To solve it you will need to obtain the Big Diamond</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Ring, which you&#039;ll find perched on the monument in the tiny park.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- Since the model&#039;s encased in a thick plastic dome, you&#039;ll need to</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>manipulate the Atomic Chihuahua using the five colored buttons in order</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>to get the ring.</details>
      <p>What is an Atomic Chihuahua?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- It&#039;s a chihuahua which has received an extreme amount of radiation (and</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>isn&#039;t too happy about it either).</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- It&#039;s also the subject of one of your Uncle Buddy&#039;s more mundane motion</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>pictures.</details>
      <p>How can destroy the tanks?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- A pressing problem, huh?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Figure out what each of the colored buttons does.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- Since the black button causes the Chihuahua to stomp, it seems your best</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>bet.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- PRESS THE BLACK BUTTON when one of the tanks is at the foot of the</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Atomic Chihuahua.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>- Pretty keen, huh?</details>
      <p>How do I defeat the puny planes?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Have you figured out what each of those buttons does?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- The red button would certainly do the trick, but...</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- ...it&#039;s better to save the Chihuahua&#039;s precious fuel resources for later</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>on.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- When one of the planes is nearby the Atomic Chihuahua, PRESS THE WHITE</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>BUTTON.</details>
      <p>How should I deal with the Japanese marines in the park?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- I suppose the black button would be quite effective.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- But most of the marines, being veritable pillars of agility, would be</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>able to scatter and escape the Atomic Chihuahua&#039;s wrath.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- You aren&#039;t cheating are you? No, I didn&#039;t think so.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- Anyway if you go through Uncle Buddy&#039;s record collection you&#039;ll find a</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>copy of the Japanese National Anthem. Put the record on and when the</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>marines stand at attention, PRESS THE BLACK BUTTON several times. That</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>should take care of them.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>- Of course there are no marines or records and you&#039;re not cheating</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>either, right?</details>
      <p>How can I stop the missile from destroying the Atomic Chihuahua?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Pressing the red button will do the job but...</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- ...fuel is precious, and there&#039;s a better way to defeat the missile.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- The tiny truck has a radar dish on it, which is pointing toward the</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Atomic Chihuahua.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- The tiny truck is guiding the rocket toward the Chihuahua.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- Therefore, destroying the truck will render the missile harmless.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>- Move the Atomic Chihuahua to the east end of the park, near the tiny</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>truck, and then PRESS THE BLACK BUTTON.</details>
      <p>How can I tell the Atomic Chihuahua to take the Big Diamond Ring?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- First, you&#039;ll have to get the Chihuahua to the east end of the park.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Once you&#039;re there, just PRESS THE BLUE BUTTON.</details>
      <p>The Chihuahua has the Big Diamond Ring. Now what?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- You want to take the ring from him.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Since the model is encased in thick plastic, it won&#039;t be easy.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- As you might have expected, you&#039;ll have to make a hole in the plastic</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>dome.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- As you might not have expected, you&#039;ll need to use the Atomic Chihuahua</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>to do so.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>- If the Chihuahua breathes fire while he&#039;s close enough to the plastic</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>dome, he&#039;ll melt a hole in the dome.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>- PRESS THE GREEN BUTTON until the Chihuahua&#039;s snout bumps up against the</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>plastic dome. Then PRESS THE RED BUTTON three times. This should produce</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>a hole big enough to reach through.</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>I&#039;m pressing the red button but the Atomic Chihuahua is only gagging. What&#039;s</details>
      <p>wrong?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Due to limited resources, the Atomic Chihuahua can breathe fire only</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>three times.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- So you&#039;d better make each use of the red button count.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- Don&#039;t use the red button to destroy tanks, planes or missiles. (If you</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>aren&#039;t sure how to destroy the Chihuahua&#039;s enemies without using the red</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>button, develop the hints to the appropriate questions above.)</details>
      <p>How do I get up the stairs in the foyer?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- You won&#039;t be able to stop the stairs from flattening out until you&#039;ve</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>been to the second floor.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- You&#039;ll have to come up with another way to get upstairs.</details>
      <p>How do I get to the second floor?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Have you tried walking up the stairs?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Hmmm. It&#039;s too bad this house doesn&#039;t have an elevator.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- Or does it?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- Give the closet a little extra scrutiny.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>When I show the slide, all that appears on the screen is a blur of colored</details>
      <p>light. What&#039;s going on?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Did you remember to focus the slide projector?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>When I show the film strip, nothing appears on the screen. What&#039;s the</details>
      <p>matter?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Did you remember to remove the lens cap?</details>
      <p>Am I a victim of subliminal advertising when I show the film strip?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- No.</details>
      <p>Okay, what am I supposed to do in the Projection Booth?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- There is a message on the slide and the strip of film.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Viewing the slide by itself or the strip of film by itself reveals only</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>meaningless bits and pieces of the message.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- Viewing both the strip of film and the slide at the same time reveals</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>the message on the projection screen.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- But you only have one turn to look at the message on the screen before</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>the message disappears as the film strip runs through the projector.</details>
      <p>Is the box of Cuban cigars important?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- It was to Uncle Buddy.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Don&#039;t go on unless you&#039;ve discovered the bust of Fidel Castro.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- Remember, only develop the answers to questions you really need.</details>
      <p>What can I do with the piano?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Have you tried playing it?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Playing the right song might cause something to happen.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- Have you solved the Projection Booth puzzle yet?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- If so, then you know what that song is.</details>
      <p>Is there a way to enter the passage to the north of the crawlspace?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Yes.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- The entrance to the passage is large enough for you to enter, but it&#039;s</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>partially blocked by the ceiling.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- Therefore, if you could raise the ceiling, you could enter the passage.</details>
      <p>How do I raise the ceiling in the crawlspace?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Since the ceiling is balanced across a wooden beam, you can think of the</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>ceiling as a see-saw of sorts.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- If you could tip the ceiling down in one half of the crawlspace, it</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>would effectively raise the ceiling in the other half.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- First, you&#039;ll need to remove one of the pillars, since they&#039;re</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>supporting the ceiling. See the next question for advice on how to go</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>about doing that.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>- Then you&#039;ll have to redistribute the weight of the ceiling so that it</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>presses down on the end of the ceiling from which you&#039;ve removed the</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>pillar.</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>- Push the piano so that it rests over the end of the crawlspace from</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>which you&#039;ve removed a pillar. (You&#039;ll probably need to push it twice in</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>the correct direction.) Doing this will tip the ceiling of the</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>crawlspace.</details>
      <p>How do I remove one of the pillars?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- The ceiling of the crawlspace is very heavy. As the game starts,</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>removing the pillars is impossible, since the ceiling&#039;s weight is evenly</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>distributed.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- If you could redistribute the ceiling&#039;s weight to one end of the</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>crawlspace, you&#039;d be able to remove the pillar at the other end.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- Bear in mind that the ceiling of the crawlspace is also the floor of the</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>parlor.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>- All of the furniture in the parlor is bolted down. All, that is, except</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>the piano.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>- To get a pillar, go to the parlor, push the piano to the north or south,</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>then go to the end of the crawlspace which is opposite to the direction</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>in which you pushed the piano, and remove the pillar.</details>
<!-- The Second Floor -->
  <h2 id="the_second_floor">The Second Floor</h2>
      <p>How do I open the panel in the ceiling?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- &quot;It won&#039;t budge from this side.&quot;</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Oh well. At least you&#039;ve learned that there&#039;s a room above this floor.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- For more information on how to get to this room, refer to the next</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>question.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>I know that there&#039;s a room above the second floor, but I don&#039;t know how to</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>get there.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>- You&#039;ll need to use the closet/elevator to get there.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>- Have you ever been on top of the closet, by walking through one of the</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>closet doors when the elevator is one floor below?</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>- If the closet moved to the second floor while you were on top of it,</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>you&#039;d be at the attic!</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>- However, there&#039;s no way to activate the elevator controls from the top</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>of the closet.</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>- Pull one of the closet pegs and read the description very closely.</details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary>- The closet doesn&#039;t really move until a peg is released. When it snaps</details>
        <details><summary>Q.</summary>back up to its angled position, the elevator is activated.</details>
        <details><summary>R.</summary>- What you need is a sort of timing device. Something to hold down the</details>
        <details><summary>S.</summary>third peg for a few turns, giving you the time get [sic] on top of the</details>
        <details><summary>T.</summary>closet.</details>
        <details><summary>U.</summary>- Examine the bucket. Carefully.</details>
        <details><summary>V.</summary>- It&#039;s rusting through on the bottom, and therefore bound to be a bit</details>
        <details><summary>W.</summary>leaky.</details>
        <details><summary>X.</summary>- You can fill the bucket with water at &quot;Garden, North.&quot;</details>
        <details><summary>Y.</summary>- Bring the closet down to the cellar. Then go to &quot;Garden, North&quot; and fill</details>
        <details><summary>Z.</summary>the bucket. Quickly return to the closet. Hang the bucket on the third</details>
        <details><summary>[.</summary>peg. Go to the foyer, open the closet door, and walk through it. If</details>
        <details><summary>\.</summary>you&#039;re on top of the closet, just wait a few turns for the closet to</details>
        <details><summary>].</summary>move upward. If you didn&#039;t end up on top of the closet, you probably</details>
        <details><summary>^.</summary>weren&#039;t quick enough in bringing the filled bucket to the closet. (Using</details>
        <details><summary>_.</summary>the patio door is a good idea.)</details>
      <p>What the heck is a newel?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- It&#039;s a wooden knob, mounted on the bannister at the bottom or (in this</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>case) the top of a staircase.</details>
      <p>What&#039;s so unusual about the newel?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Have you tried examining it?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Have you tried turning it?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- Now try walking down the stairs.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- Turning the newel toggles a mechanism on or off. This is the mechanism</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>which causes the stairs to flatten when you step on them.</details>
      <p>How do I get the velvet sack?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- If you merely open the window, the sack will fall to the ground,</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>damaging its contents.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- Since the top of the sack is sticking out from under the window, you can</details>

<!-- The Cellar -->
  <h2 id="the_cellar">The Cellar</h2>
      <p>What can I put in the computer&#039;s slot?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- It&#039;s a pretty old contraption which dates back before the days of</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>magnetic storage devices.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- So, the slot probably accepts punch cards.</details>

        <details><summary>E.</summary>Egads! How do I remove the floppy disk from the disk drive!</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- Just open up the disk drive on your computer at home and remove the copy</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>of _Hollywood Hijinx_ from the drive. It&#039;s that simple.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>- Of course, if you have a hard drive, this is not recommended.</details>
      <p>Okay, how many cards will I need, and where will I find them?</p>

        <details><summary>E.</summary>game.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- The blue card is located at the bottom of the closet shaft.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>- The green card is hidden behind the portrait of Aunt Hildegarde and</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>Uncle Buddy which hangs in the hallway.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>- The indigo card is behind the loose brick in the fireplace.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>- The orange card is lying on the patio.</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>- The red card is underneath the bath mat in the upstairs bathroom.</details>

      <p>Do I have to insert the cards in any order?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Yes.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Some of you may realize that the colors of the cards correspond to the</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>colors of the rainbow.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- There&#039;s another clue given on the business card in the mailbox.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- ROY G. BIV</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- The correct order is red orange yellow green blue indigo violet.</details>
      <p>I&#039;ve put the cards into the computer in the correct order. Now what?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Look at the lights.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Now find a telephone and dial that number.</details>
