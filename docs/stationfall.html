<!-- Aboard the S.P.S. Duffy -->
  <h2>Aboard the S.P.S. Duffy</h2>
      <p>How do I get past the door on the port side of Deck Twelve?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- You can only open the door by putting a validated Assignment Completion</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Form in the slot.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- You can only get your Assignment Completion Form validated if you</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>complete your mission.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- And your mission is to go to the space station and get that supply of</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>forms!</details>
      <p>Where can I find a forklift to move the pallets of forms?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Perhaps there&#039;s a forklift beyond the door at Deck Twelve. Or, perhaps</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>there&#039;s one aboard the space station.</details>
      <p>How can I choose a robot?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Simple. Put your Robot Use Authorization Form in the slot, then TYPE 1</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>or TYPE 2 or TYPE 3.</details>
      <p>Which robot should I choose?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Floyd, of course!</details>
      <p>How does the spacetruck operate?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- If you&#039;re having trouble getting into the truck, just OPEN THE HATCH</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>then ENTER THE TRUCK.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- All piloting is done automatically. Just put your Class Three Spacecraft</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Activation Form in the slot to activate the truck.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- Both the pilot and copilot seat must be occupied first, though. Get</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Floyd from the robot pool. When you sit in one seat, he&#039;ll sit in the</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>other.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>- Once you&#039;ve inserted the form, just type the course you want.</details>
      <p>How can I send a message on the SB radio?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Since the microphone is missing, you can&#039;t.</details>
      <p>How can I get to the space station?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- By using the spacetruck, of course. See the question about how to</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>operate the truck.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- The course number is based on the current time (look at your</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>chronometer, or simply look at the status line on the top of your</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>screen). A chart of course numbers for each time slot can be found on</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>the Assignment Completion Form in your _Stationfall_ package.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>- Remember to be seated with the hatch closed when the truck launches. Now</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>just WAIT a few turns, and you&#039;ll reach the space station, and then dock</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>automatically. If you end up in the middle of empty space, you typed the</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>wrong course number.</details>
<!-- The Command Module -->
  <h2>The Command Module (Levels 1 through 4)</h2>
      <p>How can I get the seven-pointed star?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- It&#039;s high above you, beyond your reach. You must get higher, somehow.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Don&#039;t go on until you&#039;ve explored the village.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- It&#039;s as easy as A. b. c.!</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- A. b. c. as in Arcturian balloon creature!</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- See the question about the balloon creature.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- You&#039;ll have to figure out how to get the creature to the Chapel.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>- You&#039;ve gotten the balloon to Level Three, but it doesn&#039;t enter the</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>Chapel even when you spray the can there? Well, there must be a reason</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>for that!</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>- What are some of the features of the chapel? Go back and read the sign</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>in the Pet Store again.</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>- The balloon creature is filled with hydrogen.</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>- Hydrogen is very flammable. That&#039;s why the Hindenburg exploded.</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>- The creature is terrified of the eternal flame. You&#039;ll have to turn it</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>off.</details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary>- Examine the pulpit.</details>
        <details><summary>Q.</summary>- OPEN THE PULPIT. FLIP THE SWITCH. SPRAY THE CAN. GRAB THE LEASH. TAKE</details>
        <details><summary>R.</summary>THE STAR. Yay.</details>
      <p>How does the Food Processing and Dispensing Unit work?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Have you turned it on?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- I guess the answer to &quot;How does the FPU work?&quot; is &quot;It doesn&#039;t.&quot;</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- Like all the other machinery on the station, it has been turned against</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>human beings by the influence of the alien pyramid. You&#039;ll have to look</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>elsewhere for nourishment.</details>
      <p>How does the nanofilm reader work?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Just put a spool in the reader, then turn the reader on.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- There are three spools to be found: in the Chapel, the Printing Plant,</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>and Docking Bay #3.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- You&#039;ve probably noticed that static and bizarre threats are interfering</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>with your reading of the nanofilm spools. Sorry; nothing you can do</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>about it.</details>
      <p>What does the detonator do and how does it work?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Examine it.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Open it.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- This hyperdiode looks kaput. The detonator probably won&#039;t work until you</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>replace it.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- Ah, but what series hyperdiode is it? There&#039;s that J-series hyperdiode</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>in the Studio. You could just go ahead and try using that one...</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>- The blackened diode is covered with char.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>- Why not CLEAN THE BLACKENED DIODE?</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>- Well, now you know that the J-series hyperdiode isn&#039;t correct. (If you</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>tried to use the J-series hyperdiode, you already know that.)</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>But...where is there an M-series hyperdiode? Try your reading skills...</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>- More specifically, take some nanofilm spools to the library.</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>- The spool on Chapel maintenance mentions an &quot;...iode...&quot; amidst the</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>static!</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>- There&#039;s a hyperdiode inside the seven-pointed star! Go see that</details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary>question.</details>
      <p>Is there any way to open the storage bin in the Dome?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Have you read the commander&#039;s log?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- The storage bin key is in the safe. See the question about opening it.</details>
<!-- The Command Module -->
  <h2>The Command Module (Levels 5 through 7)</h2>
      <p>How can I get things from the dispenser in the PX?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- First you need a coin. Where might you expect to find coins?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Don&#039;t go on until you explore the village.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- See the question about opening the strong box.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- Now put the coin in the slot, then TYPE 6 or TYPE 9 (depending on which</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>item you want).</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- But the item invariably gets stuck inside the dispenser. And you won&#039;t</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>be able to dislodge it on your own.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>- You&#039;ll need the ostrich. See the ostrich question.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>- Once you&#039;ve gotten the ostrich into The PX, you have to induce it to</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>dislodge the stuck item.</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>- What&#039;s the most popular myth about ostriches?</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>- They stick their heads in holes when frightened!</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>- So do something to scare the ostrich (i.e., YELL or KICK IT) or simply</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>SCARE THE OSTRICH.</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>- An alternative solution: stick the ostrich nip into the dispenser hole.</details>
      <p>Are the lights in Station Control important?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- They can tell you which of the station&#039;s systems are malfunctioning.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Green indicates a functioning system; yellow signifies a minor problem;</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>red shows a system with a serious malfunction.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- Monitor the lights as the chrons and days pass by. The situation seems</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>to get worse and worse...</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- ...then, on your third day, all the lights are green again!</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>- That isn&#039;t because all the systems are functioning again (obviously).</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>The pyramid has &quot;taken over&quot; the systems monitor board to mislead you!</details>
      <p>Can I send a &quot;help&quot; message from the Comm Center?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Push the red button.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- I guess not.</details>
      <p>How does the log reader work?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Place a tape in it. Turn it on.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- There&#039;s a log tape in the Commander&#039;s Quarters, right next door.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- Once you&#039;ve read the first entry, just keep pressing the red button to</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>read the subsequent entries.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- The log reader will overload after being on for about twelve turns.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>You&#039;ll be warned by a whining noise. The only way to prevent the</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>overload is to turn off the reader.</details>
      <p>How can I open the safe?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- You can&#039;t open the safe until you&#039;ve solved a bunch of other puzzles</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>first.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- Have you been to the Trading Post. [sic]</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- Read the sign and the instruction sheet?</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- Don&#039;t go on until you&#039;ve been In Space, beyond the airlock.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- Blow up the safe with the explosive. You&#039;ll need the drill, the</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>explosive, the detonator, and the timer (from the PX dispenser). See the</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>questions relating to those items.</details>
      <p>How can I get the drill bit out of the heating chamber?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Try TAKE THE MEDIUM DRILL BIT.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- &quot;...the opening is too small for a normal human hand...&quot;</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- ASK FLOYD TO TAKE THE MEDIUM DRILL BIT.</details>
      <p>What should I do about Oliver?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Oliver&#039;s presence seems to affect Floyd pretty deeply, but you can&#039;t do</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>anything with Oliver until he &quot;wakes up.&quot;</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- So, ignore Oliver for now. Maybe he&#039;ll wake up before the end of</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>_Stationfall_.</details>
      <p>How do I get past the security doors (into the Brig and the Armory)?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- There&#039;s an ID reader next to each security door.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- To use an ID reader, just PUT THE ID CARD INTO THE ID READER.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- Nothing happens. Perhaps your rank isn&#039;t high enough to open security</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>doors.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- Have you read the commander&#039;s log?</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- See the question about the innocuous machine in Shady Dan&#039;s.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>- Your rank is 6. Once you have reprogrammed your card for any higher rank</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>(7 through 10), putting the ID card in the reader will open the door.</details>
      <p>Where&#039;s the forklift that belongs in the Shipping Room?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- You certainly won&#039;t be able to move the pallets to your spacetruck until</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>you find it. Explore around.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- It seems to be missing. Considering how malevolent all the machinery is</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>acting, I&#039;d be worried.</details>
      <p>How can I decipher that message in the Alien Ship?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- There are clues all over the place!</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- A subtle clue comes from examining the alien skeleton.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- A less subtle clue is found in the diary of Professor Schultz.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- But the biggest clue of all is in the Mayor&#039;s Office.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- It&#039;s the piece of paper in the textbook. That paper is the mayor&#039;s</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>attempt to decipher the dots.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>- The aliens communicate not by sounds but by tastes!</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>- TASTE THE DOTS.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>- Still lost? Okay, here&#039;s a rough translation: &quot;Fellow Hunji! Sabotage</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>failed, but I have learned the Zeenak weapon&#039;s one weakness. Element</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>number 78! Reflect the emanations! Air is getting thin but...&quot;</details>
      <p>How does the drill work? Where should I use it?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- To drill a hole in, for example, the spacetruck, just type DRILL HOLE IN</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>SPACETRUCK.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- There are three different size bits scattered around the space station:</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>the small drill bit that&#039;s in the drill when you find it, the medium</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>drill bit in the heating chamber, and the large drill bit in the PX</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>dispenser.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>- The drill, like all the machinery on the station, is pretty flaky. It</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>may work several times, but you can only depend on it working ONCE. So</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>think before you drill.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>- You should drill the safe. Do you know why?</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>- So that you can put the explosive in the hole you drilled.</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>- Examine the various drill bits. Examine the explosive.</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>- Obviously, to make a hole big enough for the explosive, you need to</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>drill with either the medium bit or the large bit.</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>- But if you use the large bit, you&#039;ll have used up your one coin, and</details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary>won&#039;t be able to get the timer. Therefore, you must use the medium bit</details>
        <details><summary>Q.</summary>to drill the hole in the safe. See the questions about the detonator and</details>
        <details><summary>R.</summary>explosive for more information.</details>
      <p>How can I get past the closed iris hatch?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- You won&#039;t be able to get past the iris hatch until you&#039;ve explored the</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Command Module pretty well.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- There&#039;s a slot next to the hatch. By now, you should know that slots are</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>for forms. Have you found any applicable form?</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- Read the form from the trash can in the Printing Plant.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- It&#039;s too crumpled to fit in the slot. There&#039;s a way to uncrumple it.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>- Have you seen anything whose purpose is to remove wrinkles?</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>- The presser in the Laundry!</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>- Open the presser, put the crumpled form in it, close the presser, then</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>turn it on. But beware: don&#039;t leave the presser on any longer than you</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>have to!</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>- The form now fits the slot, but gets rejected because it isn&#039;t</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>validated!</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>- I bet you haven&#039;t read the commander&#039;s log.</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>- LOOK UNDER THE BED in the Commander&#039;s Quarters.</details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary>- STAMP THE VILLAGE ENTRY FORM WITH THE VALIDATION STAMP. You can now open</details>
        <details><summary>Q.</summary>the iris hatch by putting the form into the slot.</details>

  <h2>The Scientific Sub-Module</h2>
      <p>Is there anything important in Professor Schultz&#039; notebook?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- It should help you figure out what&#039;s going on around here: why there&#039;s</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>no one around, why all the machines are malfunctioning, etc.</details>

        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Have you ever turned on the large box with the pipes and pedals?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- It&#039;s an organ. The mutants are lulled by the sound of organ music.</details>

        <details><summary>A.</summary>- You won&#039;t find the key anywhere.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- This job calls for brute force.</details>

      <p>How can I get past the airlock?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- To use the airlock, simply open the inner door, open the airlock, close</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>the inner door, then open the outer door.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- Of course, if you&#039;re not wearing a space suit when you open the outer</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>door, you&#039;ll die from the vacuum.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- See the question about the roulette wheel.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- There&#039;s a space suit in the locker in the Flophouse.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>- You can now open the outer door of the airlock without rupturing your</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>lungs.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>- Instead, you&#039;re swept away into space! You need to wear something else.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>- The magnetic boots from the Junk Yard. Now you can open the outer door</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>and go DOWN into space. (Space is dark. You&#039;ll need a light source.)</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>- Get the headlamp from the Field Office.</details>
      <p>Why is the explosive melting?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Read the instruction sheet from the Trading Post.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- FREZONE must be kept very cold. That&#039;s why it&#039;s stored out in the vacuum</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>of space. It melts quickly when exposed to balmy, room temperature air.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- There&#039;s something you&#039;ve probably seen that&#039;s good for keeping things</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>cold.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- You might be overlooking it, because it&#039;s also something that&#039;s good for</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>keeping things hot!</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>- It&#039;s the Thermos bottle. Put the explosive inside the Thermos when</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>you&#039;re in Space. Don&#039;t forget to close the bottle. The explosive will</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>now take approximately four times as long to melt.</details>
      <p>How does the explosive work? Where should I use it?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Examine the explosive and read the instruction sheet from the Trading</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Post.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- You&#039;ll need a timer and a detonator.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- You can get a timer from the PX dispenser. See that question for</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>details.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- There&#039;s a detonator in the storage room on Level Two. See the detonator</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>question for more details.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>- You also need to drill a hole for the explosive in whatever it is you</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>want to blow up.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>- Since the explosive is the width of a pencil, the small drill bit won&#039;t</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>make a wide enough hole. You&#039;ll need to use the medium bit or the large</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>bit.</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>- If you want to blow up anything that isn&#039;t near the airlock, you&#039;ll have</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>to keep the explosive from melting. See the previous question.</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>- To blow something up, put the explosive in the drilled hole, attach the</details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary>detonator to the timer and the explosive, set the timer, and leave the</details>
        <details><summary>Q.</summary>room. Now you have to figure out what you should blow up!</details>

        <details><summary>H.</summary>- Have you seen anything that might fit those twenty tiny sockets?</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>- Plug the twenty-prong fromitz board (from the Astro Lab) into the</details>

      <p>How can I survive the charging forklift?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Take away its credit cards? Seriously, this one&#039;s easier than you think.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Do a LOOK and read the description carefully.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- Especially note the position of the forklift.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- It&#039;s right between the arms of the exercise machine.</details>

      <p>How can I avoid the crazed washing machine?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- I&#039;d take my business to a different laundromat.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- The missing washing machine from the Laundry was probably disassembled</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>for parts to make more alien pyramids.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- There is no washing machine in the game.</details>
      <p>What should I do in the Factory?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- I hate to belabor the point, but any moment now, a godzillion alien</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>pyramids will be launched from the Factory. Within a few days, each will</details>

        <details><summary>B.</summary>usually done by some grunt, like an Ensign Ninth Class from the</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Refueling Division. But explore the space station; you might learn</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>something.</details>

        <details><summary>F.</summary>found a lilac nanofilm spool? Have you read that spool?</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>- The first step, obviously, is to open the storage bin.</details>

      <p>What does Captain Fussbottom want from me?</p>

        <details><summary>F.</summary>- Remember what happened when the mouse appeared?</details>

      <p>How can I stop the aliens from vivisecting Captain Fussbottom?</p>
