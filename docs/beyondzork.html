        Help! An eldritch vapor is stealing my possessions! The vapor won&#39;t steal anything that you wield or wear. Whack it a few times with a good weapon. It&#39;ll go away. Once you&#39;ve gotten rid of the vapor, look around. You&#39;ll find your stolen possessions in the moors, scattered but intact.</p><p>
