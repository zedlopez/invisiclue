      <p>The Lore and Legends of Quendor doesn&#039;t say anything about rat-ants! Take heart. The Rat-Ant&#039;s Cookbook says plenty about peasants. Rat-ants, though small, can be quite deadly. Fight back!</p>

<!-- The Ruins -->
  <h2>The Ruins</h2>
      <p>Help! I can&#039;t kill the undead warrior! Of course not. He&#039;s not really alive. If weapons don&#039;t work, perhaps Magick will. There is a Magick item that can deal with undead creatures. THROW THE VIAL OF HOLY WATER AT THE UNDEAD WARRIOR.</p>
<!-- Underground -->
  <h2>Underground</h2>
      <p>How do I see underground? It&#039;s dark. You need a source of light. The lantern, perhaps? Perhaps not. If you&#039;ve been to the castle, reflect on the problem for a while. If not, you need to get there before continuing. Experiment with the jar. And with the mirrors. Reread the description for the Rock Wall room carefully. Blow a bubble mirror just inside the Rock Wall. The mirrors rotate, as if they were on pivots. From the secret doorway at Rock Wall: GO INSIDE. OPEN THE JAR. TAKE THE CIRCLET. BLOW A BUBBLE. TURN THE MIRROR TO THE SOUTH. Using a series of mirrors, you can reflect sunlight into any one of the Underground passageways.</p>
