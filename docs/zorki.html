        <details><summary>B.</summary>(particularly dangerous beings) are near.</details>
      <p>What do I do about the Thief?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Discretion is the better part of valor.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>You can almost always avoid a confrontation by walking away. Although</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>you may be robbed, at least you won&#039;t be killed.</details>
      <p>How many points are there in the game?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>350. Any time you say QUIT, RESTART, or SCORE, this is pointed out.</details>
      <p>How do I get out of the dungeons?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>There are six exits.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>The chimney will allow you to carry one object at a time in addition to</details>

        <details><summary>F.</summary>Probably the easiest exit (conceptually) is by way of the grating. You</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>will probably come across the other three exits while solving some of</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>the harder problems, but it is not necessary to find more than one to</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>complete the game.</details>
      <p>What is the significance of all the engravings?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The knowledgeable critic, I. Q. Roundhead, wrote a ten-volume study of</details>

        <details><summary>C.</summary>concluded that the Zorkers were very strange people.</details>
      <p>How do I kill the Thief?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The Thief is a cunning and dangerous opponent, skilled in the martial</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>arts. Novice Zorkers would do well to avoid him.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>It is possible to distract him for one move by giving him something of</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>value.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>The nasty knife is a marginally more effective weapon to use against</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>him.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>As you gain in points, you become a better match.</details>

        <details><summary>F.</summary>Nowhere. (You were warned.)</details>
      <p>Why do things move and disappear in the dungeon?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The Thief is constantly moving about.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>There is a high probability that he will take valuable objects (except</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>the gold coffin) which you have seen. There is a much lower probability</details>

        <details><summary>E.</summary>it), and he may later decide to drop it.</details>
      <p>Where are the treasures the Thief took from me?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>As he wanders about stealing things, he puts them in his bag. Whenever</details>

      <p>What do I do with the stiletto?</p>
