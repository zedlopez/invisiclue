<!-- The Beginning -->
  <h2>The Beginning</h2>
      <p>How do I get through the gate?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>No one knows you are there. You need to get their attention.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>If you HONK THE HORN or PUSH THE EYE, the butler will speak with you.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Or you can just WAIT 10 MINUTES.</details>
      <p>How do I meet the guests?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>If you WAIT or try to go somewhere, Tamara will guide you to meet them.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>It&#039;s good manners to answer their questions.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Then you can ask the guests questions, for example ASK ABOUT THE GHOST</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>or MADAM, DESCRIBE THE GHOST.</details>
      <p>How can I find the ghost?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Ask the guests about the ghost.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>The ghost usually appears late at night.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>The ghost won&#039;t appear until after midnight (if at all), so meet the</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>guests and go to dinner first.</details>
      <p>Tamara wants to chat. What should I say?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You can ask her about different things.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>You can ASK TAMARA ABOUT: JACK, HERSELF, THE GHOST, BOLITHO, DINNER,</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>DEIRDRE, THE WHITE LADY, and so on. Or TAMARA, DESCRIBE THE GHOST.</details>
      <p>What is Bolitho trying to tell me in my bedroom?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>He is trying to tell you about the ghost. You can ASK BOLITHO TO</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>DESCRIBE THE GHOST.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>He may give you a device to protect you from hostile &quot;ghosts.&quot;</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>He may also give you a hint for finding the secret passage if you</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>haven&#039;t already found it.</details>
      <p>How should I get ready for dinner?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You&#039;ve been driving all day. You&#039;re grimy and rumpled.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>You can wash up in your bathroom.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>You can look in your luggage and find something fresh to wear.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>P.S. You&#039;ll get dirty again if you go in the secret passage!</details>
      <p>I heard a dinner bell. What should I do?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Remember what Tamara said about dinner?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>She said that dinner is at eight o&#039;clock, or whenever you hear the</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>gong.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>It&#039;s time to GO TO DINNER.</details>
      <p>What should I do at dinner?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>If you didn&#039;t do so earlier, ask the guests about the ghost.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>At the end of dinner, you&#039;ll hear a tape recording.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Do as Lionel says: LOOK UNDER THE PUNCHBOWL.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>The first clue is a hint about what the treasure is.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>After Lionel mentions the treasure, ask Jack about it.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Lionel mentions a second clue; he also says who has it.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>ASK JACK (or VIVIEN, depending on the variation) FOR THE SECOND CLUE</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>THEN READ THE SECOND CLUE.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>The second clue is a hint about how to find the treasure.</details>
<!-- Getting Around -->
  <h2 id="getting_around">Getting Around</h2>
      <p>Are there any secret passages?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>In a castle like this, there probably are.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Bolitho may give you a hint.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Bolitho says you can adjust the wall mirror in your bedroom.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>But in fact you can&#039;t adjust it. EXAMINE THE WALL MIRROR.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>The mirror is actually a secret door! PUSH THE SWITCH.</details>
      <p>It&#039;s too dark to see! Where can I find a light?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>One is used by the servants to go to the basement wine cellar.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>There&#039;s a portable brass lantern in the kitchen.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>I got caught in someone else&#039;s bedroom and now I can&#039;t leave!</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>It isn&#039;t polite to snoop around other people&#039;s bedrooms.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>The other guest is probably mad at you for doing so.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>You should APOLOGIZE to the guest.</details>
      <p>Someone is ignoring me. What does this mean?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Were you rude to this person earlier?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Maybe you ignored a question, or hit or insulted him or her?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>You should APOLOGIZE to the guest.</details>
      <p>Why can&#039;t I go somewhere directly by using the GO TO command?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>If you haven&#039;t met all the guests, Tamara won&#039;t let you wander off.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Otherwise, it&#039;s a puzzle to go to that place. You have to use compass</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>directions (like NORTH or IN) to go there.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>I used the GO TO command, but I got only part way there!</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Maybe you bumped into someone on your way.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>Or you might have gotten lost in the dark.</details>
<!-- After Dinner -->
  <h2 id="after_dinner">After Dinner</h2>
      <p>Why is Jack troubled by Bolitho&#039;s note?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Have you read it?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>ASK JACK FOR THE BUTLER&#039;S NOTE THEN READ IT.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>After dinner, you should find the maid&#039;s note, then read it.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>The maid&#039;s note is on the desk in the sitting room.</details>
      <p>How do I begin my search for the ghost?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Bolitho saw the ghost. Did he tell you about it?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>If not, and it&#039;s after dinner, you&#039;re too late. Bolitho&#039;s gone.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Say YES when Bolitho asks you if you are the well-known American</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>detective. Or ASK THE BUTLER ABOUT THE GHOST.</details>
      <p>How do I identify the ghost?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>There are two ways. The first way is to find the ghost costume and some</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>evidence of who wore it. The second way is to catch the ghost on its</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>haunt and unmask it.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Asking others to describe the ghost will give you clues about its</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>identity, and may give you an idea where to start your search.</details>
      <p>How do I follow up on Bolitho&#039;s clue?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Can you find what the ghost was searching for?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>You should go where Bolitho said the ghost was searching then SEARCH</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>THE ROOM. If you show what you found to other people, you might start</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>to suspect someone.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Search the bedroom of the suspected guest for evidence that he or she</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>is the person who lost the item that the ghost was looking for. Then</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>read one of the next four answers (for example, read the RED answer if</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>you&#039;re playing the red variation).</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>RED:</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>The jewel came from the necklace that used to be Deirdre&#039;s. Jack has</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>the necklace in his bedroom because the police gave it back to him.</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>YELLOW:</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>The jewel came from Tamara&#039;s earring in the jewelry case in her</details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary>bedroom.</details>
        <details><summary>Q.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>R.</summary>BLUE:</details>
        <details><summary>S.</summary>The contact lens is Vivien&#039;s. She is missing one from her plastic box</details>
        <details><summary>T.</summary>in the wooden box in her bedroom.</details>
        <details><summary>U.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>V.</summary>GREEN:</details>
        <details><summary>W.</summary>The contact lens is Wendish&#039;s. He is missing one from his plastic box</details>
        <details><summary>X.</summary>in the medical kit in his bedroom.</details>
      <p>I think I know who the ghost is. How do I prove it?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Whoever the ghost is probably has a costume hidden. Or sometimes you</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>can catch the ghost while it&#039;s haunting. If you still can&#039;t find the</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>ghost costume, then read one of the next four answers (for example,</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>read the BLUE answer if you&#039;re playing the blue variation).</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>RED:</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>If you think Jack is the ghost, ASK BOLITHO TO DESCRIBE THE GHOST and</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>think again. If you think Deirdre is the ghost, then the costume</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>wouldn&#039;t be in the castle; you&#039;ll have to catch her when she haunts the</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>castle.</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>YELLOW:</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>The costume is not in the villain&#039;s bedroom. Look in the secret</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>passages for it and see the next question.</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary>BLUE:</details>
        <details><summary>Q.</summary>The costume is hidden in Vivien&#039;s wooden box (under other items).</details>
        <details><summary>R.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>S.</summary>GREEN:</details>
        <details><summary>T.</summary>The costume is hidden in Wendish&#039;s medical kit (under other items).</details>
        <details><summary>U.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>V.</summary>I found a ghost costume in the secret passage!</details>
        <details><summary>W.</summary>The person haunting must have dropped it there.</details>
        <details><summary>X.</summary>Probably on purpose -- to frame Iris for the haunting. See the next</details>
        <details><summary>Y.</summary>question.</details>
      <p>How do I know who wore the costume that I found?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Whoever wore it might have left some evidence in it.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>EXAMINE THE WIG.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Whoever wore the costume left some hairs behind!</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>You can EXAMINE the other guests to see whose hair color is the same.</details>
      <p>What evidence do I need to arrest the villain?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You need to find incriminating evidence, something that shows why the</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>villain would commit a crime.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>The maid found something incriminating. See the next question.</details>
      <p>What is the significance of the maid&#039;s note?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Apparently the maid found something very upsetting.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Whatever she found might incriminate the villain.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>The last paragraph of her note is a clue.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>For more hints, look in the section for the variation you&#039;re playing.</details>
      <p>The villain is about to shoot me! How do I escape?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You can escape into the secret passage, but only if the secret door is</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>already open.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Or you can spray the villain with the aerosol device, or hit the</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>villain with the wine bottle.</details>
      <p>How do I find the treasure?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The first clue (under the punchbowl) is a hint about WHAT you are</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>looking for.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>To find WHERE the treasure is, you have to get the second clue from</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Vivien (in the red variation) or Jack (in the yellow, blue, and green</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>variations).</details>
