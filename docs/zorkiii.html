      <p>How do I climb the endless stair?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>If you wish to go back to ZORK II, just switch diskettes!</details>
      <p>How do I get the sword in the stone?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>&quot;Who do you think you are? Arthur?&quot;</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>&quot;The sword is deeply imbedded within the rock. You can&#039;t even begin to</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>budge it.&quot;</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Be patient. You&#039;ll get it when the need for it arises.</details>
      <p>How can the runes be translated?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>A Runish-to-English dictionary?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Have you examined them?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Beyond that, you&#039;ll get nothing more.</details>
      <p>How do I climb the channel in the Damp Passage?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>&quot;The channel climbs too rapidly and the moss is slippery.&quot;</details>
      <p>What will increase traction?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Studded snow tires work well on glare ice.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Some purists insist on chains.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>If you were thinking of climbing the slippery moss, forget it. You</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>really can&#039;t go that way.</details>
      <p>How can I clear the rubble in the Damp Passage?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>&quot;The channel opening is blocked by tons of debris.&quot;</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>You can&#039;t.</details>
      <p>Where do I find the old and wizened man?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The runes are a very subtle hint.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>There is a chance he will appear when you enter (and only when you</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>enter) the Engravings Room.</details>
      <p>How do I waken the old and wizened man?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>He is sleeping very soundly. (Listen to that snore.)</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Try saying WAKE MAN or SHAKE MAN.</details>
      <p>What do I do about the old and wizened man?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Attacking him would not be very sporting, but it might give you a clue.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>He is described as &quot;weak,&quot; &quot;tired,&quot; and &quot;frail.&quot;</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Have you considered helping him? You might give him something he could</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>use.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Try giving him the waybread.</details>
      <p>Can the phosphorescent moss be kept alive for more than 10 moves?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Certainly. It will live throughout the entire game.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>But you will never be able to take it, move it, or use it as a light</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>source anywhere else.</details>
      <p>How can I open the Great Iron Door?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You cannot open the door.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>However, after the earthquake you will find a cleft in the rock that</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>will allow you to pass.</details>
      <p>How do I get the rust remover tube from the warlock?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>What a looney!</details>
      <p>How do I get out of the chasm?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>How did you get down to the chasm?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>The folks at Infocom would be very interested.</details>
      <p>I&#039;m trapped on the Aqueduct. What do I do?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>If you can&#039;t proceed to the north due to a collapsed segment, you&#039;re</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>stuck.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>What might have caused this segment to collapse?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>The secret is to traverse this area before it is destroyed by the</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>earthquake.</details>
      <p>Can the lake be crossed?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>&quot;Go jump in a lake!&quot;</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Seriously! Jump in and swim to one of the other shores.</details>
      <p>What is required to walk on water?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>A messianic complex?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Do you also want to move mountains?</details>
      <p>How do I catch the fish?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Just be careful that it doesn&#039;t catch _you_!</details>
      <p>What is a Roc?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It is a legendary bird of prey of tremendous size and strength. Your</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>probability of seeing it is low, but if you do, watch out!</details>
      <p>What can be done with the swamp gas?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Swamp gas burns...</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>If you could transport it across the lake, it might make a good light</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>source.</details>
      <p>How do I transport the swamp gas?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>A bottle would be useful.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Unfortunately, there are no bottles. By the way, where did you find</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>swamp gas?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Remember the introduction? If every question in this book were</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>pertinent to the game, the questions themselves would give far too much</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>away. Do not use the presence or absence of a question on a certain</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>topic as an indication of what is important, and don&#039;t assume that long</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>answers are associated with important questions.</details>
      <p>How can I get the shiny object?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Try to take it until you eventually succeed. (There is a 50%</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>probability that you will get it on any move. Although there is less</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>than one chance in a thousand that you wouldn&#039;t get it within 10 tries,</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>it could conceivably take zillions of tries.)</details>
      <p>What is the table with the &quot;Scenic Vista&quot; sign for?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Have you ever examined it?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Have you ever touched or rubbed it?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>You can look at or go to sections of ZORK I, ZORK II, ZORK III, and</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>ENCHANTER(tm).</details>
      <p>Is there anything under the manhole cover?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Try raising or moving it.</details>
      <p>How do I get a light source to the southern end of the lake?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The light sources cannot be relit once they&#039;ve gotten wet.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>They can&#039;t be taken across the lake without getting wet.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>There is no way to get a working light source to the south shore of the</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>lake.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>There is another way!</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Have you seen the grue repellent?</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>Figure out how to use the viewing table.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>Use the grue repellent to get to the Key Room and Aqueduct. The viewing</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>table is also useful for pre-positioning the light source you will</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>eventually need.</details>
      <p>How can I get to the coal in the Dead End?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You can&#039;t.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>You are limited to three moves in the areas visited with the viewing</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>table. There is no way for you to increase this. Obviously, if you</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>could stay as long as you wanted, there would have to be four games on</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>the diskette.</details>
      <p>What light source can I take to the west of the Timber Room?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>None.</details>

        <details><summary>A.</summary>Have you noticed anything you do which increases your score?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>You must fight the figure.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Have you ever looked at the figure or looked under the hood?</details>

        <details><summary>F.</summary>While the figure is badly injured, try taking the hood.</details>
      <p>Why do I see myself?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Very good question.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>This is actually a hint.</details>
      <p>How do I freeze the quicksand?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>A blast of supercold air might do the trick.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>The Great Underground Empire is far from polar regions.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>The quicksand can&#039;t be crossed. It is one of the many borders which</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>keep the Underground Empire small enough to fit on a diskette.</details>
      <p>How do I get to the ship?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Congratulations. Seeing the ship is rather rare.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Have you tried walking on water?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>This is a Viking sailor.</details>

      <p>How do I open the chest?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You can&#039;t open it.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>The man at the cliff has the only key.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>You&#039;ll have to wait for him to open it.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Wait on the ledge for him to appear and follow his directions.</details>
      <p>Can the man at the cliff be trusted?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>He certainly seems like a practical joker.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>But he has the only key to the chest.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Do exactly what he says -- and be patient.</details>
      <p>What is in the tree house?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>This could be the man&#039;s living quarters.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>The inflatable raft in the back room might be useful elsewhere.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>It is amazing that you got this far when there is no tree house.</details>
      <p>I have the treasure, but how do I mend the staff?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It cannot be fixed.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Have you tried protecting the staff (for example, throwing it off the</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>cliff) before taking the treasure?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>You&#039;ll have to decide which you prefer, the treasure or the staff.</details>
      <p>I have the staff; how do I get the treasure?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You might try killing the man before he walks away with it.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>You&#039;ll have to decide which you prefer, the treasure or the staff.</details>
      <p>What is the significance of Smokey the Bear?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>&quot;Only you can prevent forest fires.&quot;</details>
