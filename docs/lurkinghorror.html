        <details><summary>D.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>That paper doesn&#039;t look familiar!</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- Indeed, it isn&#039;t. You might wonder what happened to it.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>- It certainly seems ruined at the beginning. Maybe later pages are okay,</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>though.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>- Keep reading more of the paper as it appears.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>Now where am I? It doesn&#039;t look like G.U.E. Tech to me!</details>

        <details><summary>N.</summary>- Go down.</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary></details>

        <details><summary>Q.</summary>- There are many unusual things here.</details>
        <details><summary>R.</summary>- Wouldn&#039;t you like a souvenir of this trip?</details>
        <details><summary>S.</summary>- The stone is the only portable thing around.</details>
        <details><summary>T.</summary>- GET THE STONE.</details>
        <details><summary>U.</summary>- Now just be patient.</details>
      <p>I&#039;m home, but where&#039;s my paper?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- The hacker seems willing to check out your problem.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Wait for him to finish looking at the situation.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- Perhaps the Alchemy Department can help you.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- Maybe it&#039;s still in one of their computers.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- Go find the Alchemy Department!</details>
      <p>The hacker isn&#039;t very friendly, is he?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Why should he be friendly?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- All you&#039;ve done so far is give him trouble.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- Give him something other than trouble, for a change.</details>

        <details><summary>E.</summary>- He&#039;s mentioned food occasionally, hasn&#039;t he?</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- Maybe he&#039;s hungry.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>- Give him some Chinese food.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>- He wasn&#039;t grateful? What state did you give it to him in? Think, now, it</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>was in the fridge!</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>- Think of Goldilocks and the Three Bears. How do you like YOUR food?</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>- You can heat food in a microwave.</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>- You can tell how hot food is by touching it.</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>- To be careful, calibrate the microwave oven using the Funny Bones.</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>- Three or four minutes on HI should cook the food just right.</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>- ...but it will cool off after a while, so don&#039;t dawdle!</details>
      <p>What can the hacker help me with?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- He&#039;s a proficient hacker.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- He could probably write a program to write your term paper.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- Hackers are often good at getting into things they aren&#039;t supposed to.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- If you&#039;re going to be poking around, you might want some keys.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- He&#039;ll only help you if you&#039;re nice to him. (He won&#039;t bite the hand that</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>feeds him.)</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>- Look carefully at the hacker&#039;s description.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>- Look at his keyring.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>- Ask him about his keyring; he seems awfully proud of it.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>- Ask him for the master key, it ought to do the trick!</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>I&#039;m on the roof of the Computer Center, but there&#039;s nothing of interest</details>
      <p>here, is there?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- That&#039;s right. It&#039;s just a boring place.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- You can enjoy the weather, until you freeze to death. But that&#039;s all.</details>
<!-- Temporary Building -->
  <h2>Temporary Building</h2>
      <p>I&#039;ve never seen so much junk! - You could try moving it. - There sure is a lot of it, and it&#039;s heavy, too - Some kind of help would be nice.</p>
<!-- Aerospace -->
  <h2>Aerospace</h2>
      <p>How do I unlock the padlock?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- You need a key.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Not just any key, a really good key.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- The hacker might be able to help.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- Get the appropriate key from the hacker.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>I don&#039;t like rats! They don&#039;t like me!</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>- For temporary relief, leave by the way you came, then gather your wits.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>- For a permanent solution, kill or scare them off.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>- There are hundreds of rats, killing one at a time is certain death.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>- Explore the tunnel carefully, maybe there&#039;s something that can help.</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>- There&#039;s a steam valve in one of the Steam Tunnel rooms.</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>- Scalded rats would probably be either scared or dead.</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>- Wait for the rats to come into the room with the steam valve, then open</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>it and cook some rats.</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary>The steam valve is rusty!</details>
        <details><summary>Q.</summary>- You need more strength to open the rusty valve.</details>
        <details><summary>R.</summary>- Leverage is an elementary principle of physics...</details>
        <details><summary>S.</summary>- Loosen the valve by hitting it with something heavy.</details>
        <details><summary>T.</summary>- Now that it&#039;s loose, you can open it.</details>
      <p>Why won&#039;t the urchins let me by?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- It&#039;s as though they&#039;re controlled through the wires attached to them.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Maybe if they weren&#039;t attached, they&#039;d be nicer to you.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- There must be some way of cutting the wires.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- Let&#039;s see, the axe and the knife have a cutting edge.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- Too bad the ground is so goopy. Something that cuts like a scissors, or</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>a wire cutter.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>- A wire cutter or a bolt cutter will work nicely if you can find one.</details>
<!-- Infinite Corridor and Great Dome -->
  <h2>Infinite Corridor and Great Dome</h2>
      <p>How do I get to the east end of the Infinite Corridor?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Try waiting out the maintenance man. Eventually he&#039;ll move east.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Unfortunately, once he reaches the far end of the Infinite Corridor, he</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>still won&#039;t let you past.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- It&#039;s that waxing machine that&#039;s the problem, just shut it off somehow.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- It seems to be electrical, trace the power cord.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- No, you can&#039;t pull the power cord out... Maybe you can cut it!</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>- How about a cutting tool?</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>- There&#039;s an axe in the emergency cabinet.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>- CHOP THE CORD WITH THE AXE.</details>

        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Break the glass.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- But not with your bare hands. Wear gloves, or use the crowbar.</details>

        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Just stop the maintenance man.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- This is a slippery problem to solve.</details>

        <details><summary>D.</summary>- You need to confront him in the Infinite Corridor.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- Notice the container of Frobozz Magic Floor Wax. Looks pretty slippery.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- Drop the wax in the Infinite Corridor. The maintenance man will slip on</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>it and you&#039;ll be able to get away. (You can also pour it down on him</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>from the Great Dome area.)</details>
      <p>How do I climb the rope at the Great Dome?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- You need something to protect your hands when you climb the rope.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- WEAR THE GLOVES THEN CLIMB THE ROPE.</details>
      <p>How can I get out of the dome?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Still at the top rung?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Try lowering the ladder.</details>
      <p>I&#039;m on the Great Dome, but there&#039;s nothing of interest here, is there?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Did you notice the plug?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Lift the plug then take the note.</details>
<!-- Brown Building / Nutrition / Chemistry / Alchemy -->
  <h2>Brown Building / Nutrition / Chemistry / Alchemy</h2>
      <p>How do I unlock the door on top of the Brown Building?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- There sure are a lot of locked doors around here.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Sure would be nice if there was a key that opened them all.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- Who would have a key like that?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- Obviously someone who liked getting into everything.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- Ask the hacker about keys.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>I can&#039;t get out of the weather station!</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>- Just get rid of the flying creature.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>- Why does it seem to have come after you? Can&#039;t just be a coincidence,</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>can it?</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>- It must be after something you have.</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>- Giving the hand to the creature will get rid of it, but you&#039;ll lose the</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>hand. Not so good, after being so clever as to find it.</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>- Got anything else associated with monsters?</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>- Where did you get the stone?</details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary>- THROW THE STONE AT THE CREATURE to drive it away. (You may have to do</details>
        <details><summary>Q.</summary>this once Inside Dome and once on the Skyscraper Roof).</details>
      <p>How do I get into the Dept. of Alchemy?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- The light is on inside, maybe someone&#039;s in there.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- KNOCK ON THE DOOR.</details>
      <p>I&#039;ve gotten to the Alchemy Department. Now what?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Maybe the professor can help you.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Maybe he doesn&#039;t want to help you.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- Maybe he has something to hide.</details>
      <p>How do I get into the laboratory?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- The professor doesn&#039;t find you very interesting, does he?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Have you got anything that might pique his interest?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- Failing that, how about exciting his hatred?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- Have you anything that threatens him?</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- No, not physically! What&#039;s he been doing, you wonder?</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- Look at the lab signup sheet.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>- If you haven&#039;t seen anything else that is related to the sheet, don&#039;t go</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>on.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>- Show the professor the suicide note.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>- Then try to enter the lab.</details>

        <details><summary>B.</summary>- ...or a Volkswagen Beetle.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- It&#039;s up high.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- But not the highest.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- Outside, on the Great Dome.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- ...and under the bronze plug.</details>
      <p>How do I get out of the laboratory?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>- Consider carefully how the professor put you into the pentagram.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>- Did he use any equipment?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- Have you anything similar?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>- If not, you are doomed. Enjoy your last few minutes of life.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>- If so, try cutting the pentagram the way he cut it to put you inside.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>- ...but wait until he&#039;s in his pentagram.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>- Then leave the pentagram.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>- Still stuck in the lab? When you found the knife, did you explore the</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>tunnels nearby carefully?</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>- Ever wonder where that trapdoor in the Cinderblock Tunnel went?</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>- Could it possibly have gone in here somewhere?</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>- No, you can&#039;t see it. Maybe it&#039;s hidden.</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>- Maybe it&#039;s under something.</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>- Look at the lab bench. Notice anything interesting about it?</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>- It has wheels. MOVE THE BENCH.</details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary>- OPEN THE TRAPDOOR. Now go down into the cinderblock tunnel to avoid what</details>
        <details><summary>Q.</summary>the professor has summoned. Hurry, the timing is critical!</details>
        <details><summary>R.</summary>- Don&#039;t forget your flashlight.</details>

        <details><summary>B.</summary>- It&#039;s accessible from the file server.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>- The file server is in the computer room.</details>

<!-- Beyond the Steam Tunnels -->
  <h2>Beyond the Steam Tunnels</h2>
      <p>Not a maze! All these Wet Tunnels! - You can use standard maze mapping techniques here, if you&#039;re patient. - Isn&#039;t there a better way? - Maybe you need a guide! - Let your fingers do the walking through the muddy mazes. - Well, actually not your fingers, but the hand&#039;s fingers. - The ring from the professor might look good on your hand, but it looks even better elsewhere. - PUT THE BRASS HYRAX ON THE HAND. Now the hand will point the way through the maze.</p>
