      <p>Can Professor Wurble help me save Pittsburgh from the hideous Yogurt Slime</p>
<!-- Joe&#039;s Bar -->
  <h2>Joe&#039;s Bar</h2>
      <p>How can I get out of the bar area?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>There&#039;s no way to leave the bar through the front door.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>There&#039;s another way to leave, but you won&#039;t be able to until you&#039;ve</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>relieved your bladder.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Just enter the bathroom of your choice (NW or NE), relieve yourself,</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>then wait for a few turns.</details>
      <p>This section on Joe&#039;s Bar sure was a short section, huh?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Yup.</details>
<!-- The Prison Area -->
  <h2>The Prison Area (Phobos)</h2>
      <p>How can I get out of my cell?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You&#039;re gonna feel pretty silly when you get to the hint B.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Try OPEN THE DOOR.</details>
      <p>Is the hunk of brown food important?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Smell it.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>You could try eating the chocolate to see what happens...</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>...but since you&#039;re not hungry, it&#039;s probably best to hang onto it</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>until you need it.</details>
      <p>How can I prevent being killed by the Leckbandi guards?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Just don&#039;t go east or west from End of Hallway.</details>
      <p>Is this Trent/Tiffany character important?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You&#039;ll never finish the story without him/her.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Once you&#039;ve met in the Other Cell, he/she will follow you around. The</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>places where he/she can help you will be revealed in the hints to other</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>questions.</details>
      <p>Is there any way to light the Closet that is north of the Observation Room?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Sure. Turn on the flashlight.</details>
      <p>How can I get the basket off the shelf?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>There are two ways. Both involve increasing your height.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>If you brought the stool from the bathroom, you can get the basket by</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>standing on it.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Otherwise, find Trent/Tiffany. When he/she follows you into the closet,</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>climb on him/her.</details>
      <p>How can I leave the prison area?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The answer has something to do with the black circles on the Roof and</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>in the Closet.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>They&#039;re teleportation devices. Standing on them transports you</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>elsewhere.</details>
      <p>Is the basement important?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>No.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>This space intentionally left blank.</details>
      <p>Is the scrap of paper in the Other Cell meaningful?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Yes, it&#039;s a word search.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>It will become more meaningful once Trent/Tiffany gives you the</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>matchbook with the parts list on it.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Search for the items on the parts list within the grid of letters on</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>the scrap of paper. As you find each of the eight items, circle or</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>cross off its letters.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>When you&#039;ve crossed off the letters of all the items, the remaining</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>letters in the grid form a message.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>Namely: HISSING FRIGHTENS FLYTRAPS.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>This is one of two methods of getting past the Venus flytrap. Just HISS</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>when you&#039;re in the same location as the flytrap.</details>
<!-- Venus -->
  <h2>Venus</h2>
      <p>How can I get past the Venus flytrap?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>There are two ways. The more straightforward way is to kill it. The</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>knowledge of how to kill it comes from the scrap of paper in</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Trent/Tiffany&#039;s cell. See the previous question.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>A second way to get past the flytrap is to trap it.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Don&#039;t go on unless you&#039;ve been to Cleveland.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>You can set a trap at the tree hole (Fork, Of Sorts) using stuff you&#039;ve</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>seen in Cleveland.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>Put the trellis over the tree hole...</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>...and the leaves over the trellis.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>If the flytrap sees you setting the trap, it won&#039;t fall for it, and</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>therefore won&#039;t fall into it. &quot;Shake off&quot; the flytrap by going to the</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>Clearing. Then return to the tree hole, set the trap, go to the Jungle</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>to attract the flytrap again, and finally return to the fork and wait a</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>few turns.</details>
      <p>Is the untangling cream important?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Yes.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Don&#039;t go on unless you have the odd machine.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Don&#039;t go on unless you understand what the odd machine does.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Have you seen any use for unangling cream?</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>It&#039;s on Mars...</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>It&#039;s in the Ruined Castle area...</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>See the question about King Mitre.</details>
      <p>How can I get out of the tree hole?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>There&#039;s no reason to ever get into the tree hole.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>But if you do, you can climb out by standing on the stool or by</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>standing on Trent/Tiffany. If you don&#039;t have the stool, or if you&#039;re</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>alone, you&#039;re stuck.</details>
      <p>What is the can of stain for?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Have you read what it says on the can?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>It&#039;s for staining those black circles black. Of course, it&#039;s possible</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>that all the ones you&#039;ve seen are already black.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>See the question about the white circle at the Oasis in the Mars</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>section.</details>
      <p>What can I give the salesman to get his machine?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>There are no clues in the story about this. You&#039;ll have to try</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>everything you can find.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>OFFER THE FLASHLIGHT TO THE SALESMAN.</details>
      <p>How does the odd machine work?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Have you examined it?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>You can put one item at a time in its compartment.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>You can only turn it on while it&#039;s closed.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>It&#039;s a TEE remover. Think about that for a while.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Try using the odd machine on a number of different items.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>The odd machine removes any &quot;T&quot; from the name of the thing you use it</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>on.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>For example, open the odd machine. Put the basket in it. Close the</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>machine. Turn it on. Open it. You&#039;ll find that the basket has been</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>turned into a baske.</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>You&#039;ll also find that you can&#039;t carry things around in a baske the way</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>you could in a basket.</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>The odd machine is a lot of fun, but it&#039;s also needed to solve one</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>puzzle. You&#039;ll find out more when you get to that puzzle.</details>
      <p>Can I get into the house?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The doors are locked and you cannot unlock them.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>How would you normally get into someone&#039;s house?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Knock on the door (either front or back).</details>
      <p>How can I get the rubber hose out of the cage?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Have you tried to bend the bars?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>You&#039;ll go ape solving this puzzle.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>WAIT a bit once you&#039;ve gotten to the Laboratory.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>You end up switching identities with the gorilla of your sex, and can</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>now easily get the rubber hose. But, unfortunately, you&#039;re now trapped</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>in the cage and in the body of a gorilla! See the next question.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>Egad! I&#039;m stuck in the cage in the body of a gorilla!</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>Have you tried to bend the bars as a gorilla?</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>You need a little more energy...</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>...like you might get from a sugar rush...</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>...from eating the chocolate you were given in your cell!</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>Before the mad scientist straps you down to the slab, give the</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>chocolate to one of the gorillas, or just put it in the cage.</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>Wait until the mad scientist transfers you to the body of the gorilla</details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary>and leaves the room. (You can facilitate his leaving by getting erotic</details>
        <details><summary>Q.</summary>with your mate.) Now, eat the chocolate, bend the bars, and leave the</details>
        <details><summary>R.</summary>cage with the rubber hose.</details>
        <details><summary>S.</summary>You still need to get back into your own body, of course. How did the</details>
        <details><summary>T.</summary>mad scientist cause the transfer?</details>
        <details><summary>U.</summary>The red power switch, of course! Throw the switch and you&#039;ll be back in</details>
        <details><summary>V.</summary>your own body.</details>
        <details><summary>W.</summary>But don&#039;t forget to untie yourself first, or you&#039;ll be trapped on the</details>
        <details><summary>X.</summary>slab when you get back in your own body!</details>
      <p>Is the Vizicomm Booth important?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Yes.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>It&#039;s broken and can&#039;t be repaired, so you can&#039;t make any calls. But</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>there&#039;s something you can get in the booth.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Push the coin return knob...</details>

        <details><summary>F.</summary>This ten marsmid coin will come in very handy.</details>
      <p>How can I get off Venus?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Using the black circle at the Rocky Clifftop.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>There&#039;s also a black circle beyond the flytrap.</details>

      <p>What should I do about the frog?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You won&#039;t be able to solve this puzzle until you&#039;ve been around a bit.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>To other sections of the story, that is.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Examine the frog.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>The frog is an enchanted prince or princess.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>What&#039;s the usual way to break such an enchantment?</details>

        <details><summary>G.</summary>Repelled by the sight of the frog, eh? Do something about it.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>Type CLOSE MY EYES or COVER MY EYES WITH MY HANDS. Now try kissing the</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>frog.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>Now it&#039;s the smell of the frog that&#039;s causing the problem.</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>So, hold your nose. (If you&#039;re using your hands to cover your eyes, you</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>can pin your nose with the clothes pin from the Laundry Room.) Kiss</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>again.</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>Oh well. Now it&#039;s the sound of the frog.</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>Cover your ears with your hands. (If you&#039;re already using your hands,</details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary>you could plug your ears with the cotton balls from the Orphanage</details>

        <details><summary>T.</summary>Put the lip balm on your lips. Now kiss the frog again.</details>
      <p>How can I catch the mouse?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Mice are terrified of cats.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>There&#039;s a painting of a cat in your Cell.</details>

        <details><summary>I.</summary>seriously, Mitre is obviously pretty dejected. Do you know why?</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>Because he&#039;s turned his daughter into a 45 degree angle. (She&#039;s the</details>

<!-- General Questions -->
  <h2>General Questions</h2>
      <p>What&#039;s my goal in this story?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You&#039;ll get a better idea once you&#039;ve met Trent/Tiffany.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>A few dozen turns after meeting him/her, Trent/Tiffany will give you</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>something.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>This matchbook contains a parts list for the items that Trent/Tiffany</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>needs to build a machine that will defeat the Leather Goddesses.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Therefore, your goal is to find these eight items, and then get to a</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>location where Trent/Tiffany can build the machine.</details>
      <p>How can I change the gender of my character in the story?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You determine the sex of your character by entering either the Men&#039;s</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Room or the Ladies&#039; Room in the bar. Once you&#039;ve established your</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>gender, you can&#039;t change it without restarting.</details>
      <p>The scoring seems pretty cockamamie. How does it work?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You always get points at given places in the story, but there are</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>elements of randomness.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>For one thing, you don&#039;t always get the same number of points each time</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>you reach the same point in the story. For example, for reaching the</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>prison cell on Phobos, you will get somewhere between 1 and 8 points.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Another element of randomness: when you use the STATUS command, you are</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>told the total points that your score is &quot;out of.&quot; This number starts</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>at 9309, but decreases randomly each time you get points.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>Your points increase and your &quot;out of&quot; number decreases, until they</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>finally meet on the final turn of the story.</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>This is all designed to confuse you, of course.</details>

        <details><summary>M.</summary>Shucks! It won&#039;t let me into LEWD mode.</details>

      <p>I&#039;m not really picking up the 3-D in the comic. Can you give me some tips?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Sure. For one thing, make sure you have the blue &quot;lens&quot; over your right</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>eye, and the red &quot;lens&quot; over your left eye.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>It takes a few seconds for your eyes to adjust. The 3-D effect should</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>improve noticeably within twenty seconds or so.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Hold the comic directly in front of you and move it slowly toward and</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>away from your face until the 3-D effect is maximized.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>Where else but here could you develop invisible ink to learn how to</details>
