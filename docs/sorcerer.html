      <p>Is there any significance to the cannon?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Yes. REACH INTO THE CANNON.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>LOOK INSIDE IT.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Hmmm. A pile of identical scrolls that bite.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Perhaps appearances are deceiving in this case.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Look at your infotater again.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>The pile of scrolls is actually a group of yipples.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>But there must be a real scroll that they are imitating.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>Yipples are allergic to certain animal wastes.</details>

        <details><summary>A.</summary>It&#039;s difficult to say for certain.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Perhaps an ancient battle between two powerful wizards?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Perhaps a cannonball?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Perhaps not.</details>
      <p>Is there any significance to the moss and lichens in the Slimy Room?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Lichens are usually an indication of moisture.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Some species of moss are phosphorescent.</details>

        <details><summary>A.</summary>You can JUMP ACROSS THE CHASM. This will work 20% of the time.</details>

        <details><summary>C.</summary>Cast the IZYUK spell on yourself, and then go WEST.</details>
      <p>How can I climb the zorkmid tree?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You can&#039;t.</details>
      <p>Can I pick the zorkmid coins from the zorkmid tree?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Try it.</details>

      <p>Is there any significance to the Hall of Carvings?</p>

        <details><summary>B.</summary>There&#039;s a way to make the dragon come alive.</details>

        <details><summary>E.</summary>Try casting MALYON on the dragon carving.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>It doesn&#039;t seem to be powerful enough.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>You&#039;ll also need the YONK spell. If you don&#039;t have it yet, visit Fort</details>

      <p>How can I make the invisible carvings appear?</p>

        <details><summary>B.</summary>Hall...</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>...but you probably had to give up the ZIKKLE spell to the rockworm</details>

        <details><summary>E.</summary>Invisible carvings? ZIKKLE spell? Rockworm tribe?</details>
      <p>Who built the underground highway?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Probably one of the Construction Guilds.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>It seems to be a relic of the Great Underground Empire.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>It was probably built during the reign of King Duncanthrax or one of</details>

        <details><summary>C.</summary>Have you tried typing GNOME, OPEN THE GATE?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Of course, you&#039;ll have to wake the gnome before you can talk to him.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>He won&#039;t open the gate until you give him a zorkmid.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>You can get one from beyond the chasm, near the Crater.</details>

        <details><summary>E.</summary>River Bank, Hollow, Surface of Lagoon, Lagoon Floor, and Belboz&#039;s</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Hideout.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>You might want to try sleeping in those locations, just to see what</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>happens...but do a SAVE first.</details>
      <p>Are the dreams meaningful?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>No, none of the dreams contains any useful information.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>In fact, these dreams all appeared in Enchanter(tm), also.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Perhaps you suffer from recurring dreams.</details>
      <p>Is the YOMIN spell useful?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Not really.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>It is sort of interesting to use, though.</details>
      <p>What is guano?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>GUANO -- n. (gwan-o) A substance composed chiefly of excrement and used</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>as fertilizer.</details>
      <p>Where is the scroll with the ZIKKLE spell?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The leader of the rockworm tribe can tell you.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>But first you need to learn rockworm speech.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>You can do that by reading the invisible carvings in the Hall of</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Carvings.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>You can make them visible using the ZIKKLE spell.</details>
      <p>How can I dry out wet spell books and wet scrolls?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You can&#039;t. Once your spell book or a scroll has gotten wet, it&#039;s</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>useless.</details>
      <p>Is the VEZZA spell important?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It provides a few hints.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>But you could finish the game without ever using it.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Note that two of the glimpses are previews of the third Enchanter game:</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>the pile of white blocks, and the Guildmasters meeting in Borphee.</details>
      <p>Why do I sometimes suddenly cease to exist?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Don&#039;t continue unless you&#039;ve used the GOLMAC spell.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>A time travel paradox is involved.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>One way to &quot;poof&quot; out of existence is to enter the lower chute after</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>casting GOLMAC without informing your younger self of the combination.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>This sets up a paradox.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Another way to &quot;poof&quot; is to cast GOLMAC on yourself a second time (the</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>scroll re-appears on the ground of the Slanted Room when you GOLMAC). A</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>second dose of this spell sends you too far back in time to meet your</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>younger self, thus creating another paradox.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>Two other ways to &quot;poof&quot; are to leave the Slanted Room before casting</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>GOLMAC, or to carry the shimmering scroll out of the Slanted Room.</details>
      <p>How were the spells and potions named?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>GNUSTO, FROTZ, REZROV, and IZYUK are taken from Enchanter.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>FWEEP is the sound that the deranged bat in Zork I makes. Perhaps it is</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>repeating the last word it ever heard as a human.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>AIMFIZ is ZIFMIA backwards. ZIFMIA, in Enchanter, causes someone to be</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>transported to YOUR location.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>GOLMAC is short for gold machine, the time travel device in Zork III.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>The gold machine was probably imbued with this spell.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>YOMIN is an anagram of the name of an actor who played a famous</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>mind-prober on a sci-fi TV show.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>MALYON is a corruption of Pygmalion, a sculptor who (according to</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>ancient Greek legend) brought his creation to life.</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>FOOBLE is a potential reset code in Suspended(tm).</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>YONK is a reference to the author&#039;s birthplace.</details>
