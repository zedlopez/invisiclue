      <p>How do I read the charge indicator on the ray gun?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It is, unfortunately, unreadable.</details>
      <p>How are the settings on the ray gun changed?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The strange knobs and antennae look promising.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>But they can&#039;t be moved or adjusted in any way.</details>
      <p>Can I fix the gun so it won&#039;t misfire?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Yes.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Take a close look at the descriptions of the misfire and the normal</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>blast.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>The misfire has &quot;silvery rays,&quot; the second shot has &quot;orange rays.&quot;</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Did you ever try shaking the gun or looking into the barrel before the</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>first shot?</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>Remove the silver rod. The gun will work much better.</details>

        <details><summary>A.</summary>What do most glass cleaners use as an active ingredient?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Ammonia.</details>

      <p>How do I leave through the Yellow Airlock?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>&quot;The door appears to be jammed. There may be debris outside blocking</details>

        <details><summary>C.</summary>Push again.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Be careful, there could be debris from an accident outside. You must</details>

      <p>Once I am drifting in space, how do I get back to the Artifact?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>&quot;Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.&quot;</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Throwing an item will not be enough to overcome your velocity away from</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>the Artifact.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>You might try using the ray gun (if you were fortunate enough to take</details>

        <details><summary>F.</summary>As you are no doubt now aware, you can return, but you cannot return</details>

      <p>What is the metal basket for?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It is perfect for storing all those clumsy crystal rods.</details>
      <p>How do I stop the air from becoming unbreathable?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You must make &quot;the necessary repairs in time.&quot;</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Learn the use of the ship&#039;s equipment.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>The necessary machinery is in the Repair Room.</details>
      <p>How do I get to the Green Dock?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>If you have been mapping carefully, you should realize that its</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>entrance is somewhere in the Warren.</details>
      <p>Where is the charcoal?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>&quot;Charcoal&quot; and &quot;coal gas&quot; are rather strange hints.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Have you done anything that might cause the release of methane (which</details>

        <details><summary>A.</summary>Have you examined it?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Have you searched through it?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Try searching again.</details>
      <p>What is the hole in the garage?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You might try climbing down...(Do a SAVE first!)</details>
      <p>How do I turn on the lights in the darkened area?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You will not find a simple switch in the area.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>You will need to learn to use the equipment on the Artifact.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Have you been to the Computer Room and the Repair Room?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>The necessary machine is in the Repair Room.</details>
      <p>Is there anything special about the projector in the Observatory?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>&quot;...the colors of the dots are not what you&#039;d expect, though, and range</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>throughout the spectrum.&quot;</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>This is not a spectral shift due to speed, since you are not traveling</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>at anywhere near the speed of light and the colors range throughout the</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>spectrum.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Something is causing refraction of the light.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>Is there something in the projector?</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>Look through the visor fragment or the black crystal rod to filter the</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>light so that you are not blinded.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>Remove the clear crystal rod from the projector.</details>
      <p>Where do I find the orange crystal rod?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Did you notice that raw unicorn meat is orange in color?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Generally meat changes color when cooked.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>If the orange rod were hidden in a slab of meat, cooking the meat might</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>make it apparent.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Since there is no place where you could use an orange rod, and no slab</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>of unicorn meat, I&#039;m sure that no one has gotten this far.</details>
