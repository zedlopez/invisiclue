        Some advice: Like all good detectives throughout history, you will have to do a lot of legwork. You should check out the house and all of the grounds, examine everything, analyze everything, check for fingerprints, etc.; you must be diligent. If you suspect Ebullion in the sugar, have it analyzed for Ebullion. In general, it is a good idea to ask each of the characters about all of the others. Sometimes by comparing stories you can learn something. Keep an organized record of the results of your investigation. Read very carefully the Inspector&#39;s Casebook that came with the game. Also be sure to read and refer to the Coroner&#39;s examination, the letter from Coates, and the police interviews with those who knew the deceased well. If you find out anything that may contradict what someone has said or that might be of interest to them, ask them about it, show it to them, or confront them with it. If anyone acts suspiciously, follow them. Watch what they do. Much of what you need to learn will come out only if you keep after the suspects in a &quot;Columbo-like&quot; way (in other words, putting pressure on them until they react).</p><p>
        Communicating with DEADLINE: Some people find it frustrating when their words or sentence structures are not understood. The Infocom series of games is considered to have the best language-handling ability of any programs available for microcomputers. DEADLINE is among the best of this elite group. However, probably due to its real-life setting, some players expect more understanding. A careful reading of the Instructor&#39;s [sic] Casebook, especially &quot;Dealing with Suspects&quot; and &quot;Commonly Encountered Terms,&quot; should be very helpful. Once you get the hang of it, the limitations will be less frustrating.</p><p>

        In this section, develop the clues _only_ if the condition is met.</p><p>
        Someone acted strangely at the will reading or soon after: If this person left in a hurry, go on. Develop Hidden Question 5.</p><p>
        You have analyzed the footprint: Develop Hidden Question 25.</p><p>
        You have found a couple of holes: Continue only if you have found a pair of holes in the rose garden. What might fit in them? Try the ladder (remember that it rained Wednesday night). There was a way into and/or out of the library, despite the locked door. You should search the area carefully. Search around the holes again. (It may take you a few tries to find what you are looking for.)</p><p>
        You have found a destroyed document: How do you think it got there? Did you notice anyone acting suspiciously earlier? The document didn&#39;t just appear in the water. George got it from somewhere and threw it there. He began acting strangely when he realized there was a new will which Mr. Coates didn&#39;t know about. Follow him when he first starts acting strangely. Develop Hidden Question 5.</p><p>
        Someone (other than Mr. Robner) has died: If it is Ms. Dunbar, go on. Otherwise, don&#39;t develop any further. Develop Hidden Question 27 and then continue with the next hint for this question. Did anything peculiar happen before this apparent suicide? Did anyone other than George, Mr. Coates, Duffy, or you leave the house? Did you follow (or watch from the guest room window)? Mr. Baxter and Ms. Dunbar met in the tool shed. What happened there? Did you watch through the tool shed window? Try looking through several times during the course of the discussion. Might this suicide be a murder? Did you notice anything odd about the scene of the &quot;suicide&quot;? Where is the pen Dunbar used to write the suicide note? Develop Hidden Questions 7 and 8.</p><p>
        You have entered the attic: Develop Hidden Question 26.</p><p>
        You have found the hidden closet: Develop Hidden Question 6.</p><p>
        After you have discovered the missing paintings: Don&#39;t go on if you haven&#39;t been in the cellar. You _must_ be cheating.</p><p>
        You have found a diary: If it is Mrs. Robner&#39;s diary, go on. Otherwise, don&#39;t develop any further. Don&#39;t unlock it until you are positive it is Mrs. Robner&#39;s. Did you find the key under Mrs. Robner&#39;s mattress? You are only making it more difficult for yourself by cheating in this manner.</p><p>
        You have solid proof of the method of Mr. Robner&#39;s death: If you don&#39;t have the lab report from analyzing the fragment, don&#39;t go on. Develop Hidden Questions 10 through 18.</p><p>

        Do not look at these until you have finished the game. Of course, killing yourself ends the game. Sometimes, if you try to kill another character or attack them in certain other ways, the game will end (often somewhat humorously). Arresting someone before you have proof that it was a murder results in a refusal by the district attorney to seek an indictment. If it is Baxter whom you arrest, there are two variations on this -- depending on whether you have seen the papers on the Focus scandal. In all these scenarios, you are chastised by your superior for not being more careful. If you arrest George after seeing the new will or after seeing him in the process of destroying it, the jury acquits him. They evidently feel that destroying the will is insufficient evidence for a guilty verdict. If you arrest Mrs. Robner after opening her mail or listening in on her call to Steven, the grand jury declines to indict &quot;citing, among other things, a lack of evidence linking her with the execution of the crime.&quot; If Baxter is arrested after you have seen the lab report confirming that Mr. Robner was murdered, the jury acquits him. They cite the lack of a motive or the means to administer the drug. He is also acquitted if arrested after you have proof of murder and the documents implicating him in the Focus scandal. The jury feels the lack of means of administering the drug without a struggle is a serious flaw. If you arrest George and Baxter, the district attorney throws out your case, noting that the only link between the two was hatred. If you arrest them after seeing the new will (or seeing George trying to destroy it), seeing the notepad note, and seeing the papers on the Focus scandal, the D.A. spends much more time interrogating them. Although he realizes they had motives, he decides not to indict them since &quot;no coherent and consistent theory could be proposed which involved the two of them conspiring to murder Mr. Robner.&quot; Arresting Mr. Baxter after Ms. Dunbar&#39;s death can lead to a number of different endings. If you saw the suicide note, pen, or saw Mr. Baxter leaving the scene of the shooting but have not yet established a motive for Baxter to kill Robner, Baxter is found guilty only of the death of Ms. Dunbar. If you have established a motive (seen the Focus papers and read the note), Baxter is found guilty of both murders. If you have no evidence that Baxter murdered Dunbar, there are two possible endings, depending on whether you have proved a motive for Baxter to have killed Robner. In each of these endings, the jury acquits Baxter, believing that Dunbar murdered Mr. Robner and then committed suicide. If you surprise Mr. Baxter on his way to kill Ms. Dunbar, the game ends in your death. If you arrest Ms. Dunbar after witnessing her meeting with Baxter after you have confronted her with the lab report, she is later found dead of an apparent suicide while out on bail during her trial. There are several possible endings if you arrest both Ms. Dunbar and Mr. Baxter. If you have no evidence of murder, the D.A. refuses to seek an indictment. If you haven&#39;t proved a motive with the Focus scandal papers, the grand jury refuses to indict them. If you have the Focus papers but haven&#39;t seen the note, Baxter and Dunbar are tried -- and several jurors believe them to be guilty -- but they are not convicted since there is nothing relating the old Focus scandal to the murder. If you have proof of murder, the note, and the Focus papers, you must still disprove Baxter&#39;s alibi for the night of the murder (most of the jurors will vote to convict, but a couple of them will feel there is reasonable doubt). Only if you have gotten conflicting stories from Baxter and Dunbar about the night of the murder by confronting them with the ticket stub while the other is not in the room to hear the story, can you convict the two of them.</p><p>
