        <details><summary>B.</summary>Someone replaced the stimulant in the syringe with poison.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Someone is trying to kill you.</details>

        <details><summary>C.</summary>Ask that person about the syringe.</details>

        <details><summary>C.</summary>Bill is running away because you know he tried to kill you.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>One way to stop him is to close the docking tank roof when he first</details>

<!-- THE BATTLE -->
  <h2>THE BATTLE</h2>
      <p>Where&#039;s the Snark?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Try asking Commander Bly.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Or any of the crew members.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Go southeast from the Aquadome.</details>
      <p>I have spotted a cloud of silt ahead. Should I continue?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It might be the Snark. Are you prepared to deal with it?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Yes, you should continue.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Besides, you don&#039;t have any choice.</details>
      <p>How did Sharon get in the Sea Cat?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Hitch-hiked?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Dr.Thorpe picked her up at the Research Lab.</details>
      <p>Is Sharon a traitor?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>She opened the circuit breaker, didn&#039;t she?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>She left the catalyst capsule out of the Scimitar, didn&#039;t she?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>And now she is in the Sea Cat with the man who is trying to kill you.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>What do you think?</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Try saying something to her over the sonarphone.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Of course she isn&#039;t a traitor. She was just playing along with Dr.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>Thorpe in the hopes of stopping him.</details>
      <p>Is Tip a traitor?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Tip, your good buddy, pal, and friend -- a traitor?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Tip, who has stood by you in this game while you killed both yourself</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>and him many times, a traitor?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>No way. You should be ashamed of yourself for even developing the</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>answers to this question.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>You owe Tip an apology.</details>
      <p>Am I a traitor?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Why are you wasting your developing fluid on this answer?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Go ahead and develop, there&#039;s plenty of fluid.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>And plenty more dumb answers.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>See?!</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>You can stop now.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Some people never learn!</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>Absolutely never!!!</details>
      <p>Why can&#039;t I get around the Snark?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Are the Snark and the Sea Cat moving too fast?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Maybe you should move faster.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Try setting the throttle to medium.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Better yet, try setting the throttle to fast.</details>
      <p>What should I do with the dart?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You could tranquilize the Snark.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Or maybe that isn&#039;t such a good idea.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>If you tranquilize the Snark, there won&#039;t be much to stop Dr. Thorpe</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>from blasting you with his rocket.</details>
      <p>What should I do with the bazooka?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You could try shooting the Snark.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>But the Snark has tremendous scientific value, so it would be a waste</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>to shoot it.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Another good reason not to shoot the Snark with the bazooka is that</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>then Dr. Thorpe will have a clear shot at you!</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>So why not shoot the Sea Cat&#039;s power pod and disable it?</details>
