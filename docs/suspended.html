      <p>How do I read the sign in the Primary or Secondary Channel?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You&#039;ll need a robot with visual capabilities.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Iris is the only one who can read them.</details>

        <details><summary>E.</summary>You can&#039;t move the signs, so how about a picture of them?</details>

        <details><summary>G.</summary>Plug the TV into the hole in the Primary or Secondary Channel. Iris</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>will take over from there.</details>

        <details><summary>D.</summary>What khaki cable?</details>
      <p>Is there any use for the blue cable?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It can be used to replace the malfunctioning blue cable.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>But there is no malfunctioning blue cable.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>So, no.</details>
      <p>How can I figure out what to replace to get the FCs working properly?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Figure out which cable is malfunctioning in the Primary Channel.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Have Poet touch all the cables.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Replace it with a wire of the same color.</details>
