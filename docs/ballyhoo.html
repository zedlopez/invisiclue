      <p>Why is Comrade Thumb playing with the water fountain in the Connection?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. LOOK AT COMRADE THUMB.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. He&#039;s not playing with the water fountain. He&#039;s trying to get a drink of</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>water, but he&#039;s too short!</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>3. If you don&#039;t do anything, he&#039;ll eventually give up and walk away.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>4. If you do help Comrade Thumb with the water fountain, he&#039;ll be</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>grateful, and he&#039;ll help you later in the story.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>5. You can help him by typing HELP COMRADE THUMB or LIFT UP THE MIDGET.</details>
      <p>Why is Comrade Thumb performing acrobatics and singing in the Back Yard?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. He&#039;s a circus performer; he&#039;s paid to perform for people like you.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. Remember to APPLAUD when he&#039;s done; it&#039;s only polite.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. Also watch him go through the turnstile when he&#039;s done performing. You</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>might get an idea.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>I got called a lotlice, and then Chuckles slammed the door on me. How can I</details>
      <p>get into Clown Alley?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Circus performers don&#039;t particularly like townies.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. Disguise yourself; Chuckles might not realize who you are until too</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>late.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>3. Did you see any props anywhere?</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>4. TAKE THE CLOWN MASK from Beside the Big Top and WEAR IT, then KNOCK ON</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>THE DOOR.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>I keep getting thrown out of Clown Alley!</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>1. You&#039;ll always get thrown out of Clown Alley, but if you get booted</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>after only being there for 2 turns, then you&#039;ve got real problems.</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>2. Conceal your identity!</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>3. Keep your mask on and CLOSE THE DOOR.</details>
      <p>What is Comrade Thumb saying to Chuckles?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. It&#039;s in Russian, but since Chuckles and Thumb are roomies, Chuckles</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>probably understands.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>2. Thumb is warning Chuckles that you are, in fact, not Malcom.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>3. If you help Thumb get a drink of water at the Connection, he won&#039;t turn</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>you in.</details>
      <p>I&#039;m in Clown Alley. Now what?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. You don&#039;t have much time in this room. But there&#039;s much to learn.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. Since Chuckles thinks you are Malcom, he&#039;s not afraid to gossip.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. Listen to what he says. It&#039;s important.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>4. More on this later.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>5. Also, explore whatever you can.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>6. LOOK IN THE ASHES. There&#039;s evidence in there!</details>
      <p>What was Chuckles talking about?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. You should look up &quot;grift&quot; and &quot;Annie Oakley&quot; in your circus program.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. We won&#039;t tell you what they mean, but we will tell you where to go.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. If you haven&#039;t gotten through the turnstile near the Connection yet,</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>don&#039;t develop any more hints.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>4. The elephant tent is south of where you enter the Midway.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>5. What you are looking for is in the Menagerie Nook.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>Is the ash tray important? Chuckles took it away from me.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>1. Yup!</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>2. There&#039;s something in it you should be interested in.</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>3. And it&#039;s not the ashes.</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>4. LOOK IN THE ASHES.</details>
      <p>I just saw Thumb again. What does his flailing, babbling, and pointing mean?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. He&#039;s trying to tell you something.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. Thumb taps you on the foot. Don&#039;t you remember that happening before?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. He&#039;s pointing toward where he tapped you earlier.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>4. He wants you to go to the Blue Room again.</details>
      <p>Why is Chuckles standing outside of Katzenjammer&#039;s trailer?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. He&#039;s not just doing cherry pie.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. He&#039;s preventing you from entering the trailer.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. Do you remember what Andrew Jenny said about a meeting?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>4. Chuckles is guarding the trailer before the meeting takes place.</details>
      <p>How do I get Chuckles away from Katz&#039;s trailer?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Maybe you can scare him away.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. Have you examined all the evidence up to this point?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. Have you asked Harry about all the evidence?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>4. If so, then you know that Chuckles is Eddie Smaldone. See the Eddie</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Smaldone question.</details>
<!-- Harry -->
  <h2 id="harry">Harry</h2>
      <p>Who is Harry?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Harry is the guard in the burned cage near the turnstile in the Back</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Yard.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>2. He used to be the animal trainer, before his accident. You ought to ask</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>him about himself, sometime.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>3. He&#039;s been around a long time, so he knows a lot about everything at the</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>circus.</details>
      <p>Why isn&#039;t Harry interested in anything I show him?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Have you examined Harry carefully?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. Why would he be wearing sunglasses on a dark summer night?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. He&#039;s blind! He can&#039;t see anything you SHOW him.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>4. You have to GIVE him things to feel, to get him to talk about them.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Harry claims I&#039;ve asked him before about Chelsea, and I haven&#039;t, I swear!</details>
      <p>How can I get him to tell me about her?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Tell Harry you didn&#039;t ask him before: HARRY, NO.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. When he tells you &quot;didn&#039;t you?&quot; respond fervently: NO.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. Stubborn, isn&#039;t he? Can you confuse him into telling you?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>4. When he tells you &quot;Did so,&quot; respond fervently, DID SO.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>5. He doesn&#039;t tell you much, though, even when he tells you.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>6. Was it really worth the effort?</details>
      <p>What will Harry talk about?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Harry will tell you his opinions of most of his fellow performers,</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>human and animal, and some of the items you find.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>2. A complete list of what Harry will talk about follows. Don&#039;t read this</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>unless you really need help.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>3. You can ASK HARRY ABOUT: HANNIBAL, THE LIONS, MAHLER, THE FAT LADY,</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>RIMSHAW, COMRADE THUMB, THE ROUSTABOUT, HERR KATZENJAMMER, CHUCKLES THE</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>CLOWN, MR. MUNRAB, ANDREW JENNY, BILLY MONDAY, THE FIRE-DAMAGED CAGE,</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>and EDDIE SMALDONE (after you&#039;ve read about him).</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>4. If you GIVE THE WHIP or GIVE THE CIGARETTE CASE TO HARRY, he&#039;ll also</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>respond.</details>
<!-- President William Howard Taft -->
  <h2 id="president_william_howard_taft">President William Howard Taft</h2>
      <p>What do I do with President William Howard Taft?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. He&#039;s just another cardboard character in another Infocom game.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. He was the 27th President of the United States of America. He was also</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>the biggest president ever.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>3. By biggest, we mean fattest.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>4. So you can HIDE BEHIND TAFT if you want to.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>5. Other than that, there&#039;s nothing special you should do with President</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>Taft.</details>
<!-- Tina -->
  <h2 id="tina">Tina</h2>
      <p>How do I get Tina to stand up?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. She is one fat lady.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. Maybe you could scare her into standing up.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. A mouse might frighten her enough.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>4. Put the mouse at her feet.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>5. Then again, Tina probably can&#039;t see her feet.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>6. Come to think of it, she can&#039;t even see the ground.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>7. Tina never stands up. Tina can&#039;t even walk. The circus roustabouts use</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>a crane to put her in her tent each day.</details>
      <p>How do I get Tina&#039;s attention?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. She seems wrapped up in her own huge world.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. Maybe you should try to get her to take that radio out of her ear.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. No luck with the radio, huh? Why not go where the radio isn&#039;t?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>4. Just can&#039;t seem to get her to respond, eh? Well, there must be only one</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>thing on the mind of a person that size.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>5. I&#039;ll bet some food will endear her to you.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>6. Give some food to Tina.</details>
      <p>How do I get the radio from Tina?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Don&#039;t go any further unless you have gotten Tina&#039;s attention.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. Now that you have her attention, try to distract her from the radio.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. Type TINA, HELLO.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>4. Then TAKE TINA&#039;S HAND.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>5. Then PAT TINA&#039;S HAND or SHAKE IT or KISS IT.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>6. Her reaction seems to indicate that she no longer holds the radio.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>7. Well, don&#039;t just stand there. Go to the other side of Tina and get the</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>radio!</details>
      <p>Where can I get some food that Tina will eat?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. What? You want to make her even fatter?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. Well, there doesn&#039;t seem to be any such food on the circus grounds now.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. There probably were concession stands and hawkers selling food during</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>the big top performance.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>4. If only there were some way to remember what happened during the</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>performance.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>5. A good hypnotist can usually jog one&#039;s memory.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>6. Why don&#039;t you pay a visit to Rimshaw?</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>I finally got the radio. But all it picks up is static.</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>1. Well, Tina certainly managed to get it to work. What has she got over</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>you (besides about 700 pounds)?</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>2. Not only is she massive, she&#039;s described as being &quot;mountainous.&quot;</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>3. Unless you&#039;re Manute Bol, I think Tina is somewhat taller than you.</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>4. Maybe if you find a high place, the radio reception will improve.</details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary>5. The radio will only receive signals in these locations: the Platform,</details>
        <details><summary>Q.</summary>On the Wagon, Top of Cage, On the Tent, and Walking a Tightrope.</details>
      <p>Are there any radio stations worth listening to?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Unfortunately, most pop music and talk show stations on AM radio aren&#039;t</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>worth listening to.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>2. If you&#039;re lucky, there might be a cultural radio station in town.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>3. Didn&#039;t just such a cultural station advertise in the circus program?</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>4. Look in the circus program for the radio station advertisement and turn</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>the radio dial to that frequency.</details>
<!-- Rimshaw -->
  <h2 id="rimshaw">Rimshaw</h2>
      <p>How do I get Rimshaw to teach me how to hypnotize people?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Did you ask him to teach you?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. Why don&#039;t you try to hypnotize him?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. Rimshaw started learning his skills as a young apprentice, slowly</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>honing his craft. Through endless repetitions and tireless practice, he</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>gradually mastered his mystic art and its secrets. His is a thankless</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>job, a solitary one that he takes silent pride in, yet he is very</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>remiss to discuss even the most mundane surface details with</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>rubberneckers and the curious.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>4. He&#039;s not going to teach you how to tie your shoes.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>5. You&#039;ll have to rely on Rimshaw&#039;s skills if you would like someone else</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>to be hypnotized.</details>
      <p>Who can I compare Rimshaw with?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. No one. He&#039;s Rimshaw the Incomparable.</details>
      <p>YOW! I was in the Hypnotist&#039;s Parlor, but where am I now?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. If you asked Rimshaw to hypnotize you, go to answer 3. Otherwise, read</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>answer 2.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>2. We have no idea where you are.</details>

      <p>How can I get the roustabout to bring back the net?</p>

<!-- The Black Jack Dealer -->
  <h2 id="the_black_jack_dealer">The Black Jack Dealer</h2>
      <p>What are the rules to playing blackjack?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. The object of the game is to get closer to a total point count of 21</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>than the dealer, without going over. If you get closer than the dealer</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>(without going over 21) or the dealer goes over 21, you win the amount</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>of the bet. If the dealer is closer to 21 or you go over 21, you lose</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>the amount of the bet. If you and the dealer tie, then nobody wins</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>(this is called a &quot;push&quot;). Each card counts its value (e.g., a six is</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>six points), with some exceptions. A jack, queen, or king counts ten</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>points; and an ace can count as either one or eleven points, whichever</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>is most advantageous. Suits have no significance at all.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>2. First the cards are dealt. If you have 21 with your first two cards</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>(called &quot;blackjack&quot;), you win immediately; if you have blackjack, you</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>win one and a half times the amount of your bet. If the dealer is dealt</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>blackjack, you lose immediately.</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>3. If no one has blackjack, then you can refuse more cards (called</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>&quot;sticking,&quot; &quot;holding,&quot; &quot;standing,&quot; or &quot;staying put&quot;) or you can accept</details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary>more cards (&quot;hitting&quot;) to try to get a better point count. If you go</details>
        <details><summary>Q.</summary>over 21, you automatically lose. Once you stick, then the dealer tries</details>
        <details><summary>R.</summary>to improve his hand under very strict rules: No matter what you have,</details>
        <details><summary>S.</summary>the dealer must take more cards until his total is 17 or larger. Then</details>
        <details><summary>T.</summary>he must stop.</details>
      <p>Should I play blackjack?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. You don&#039;t need money to solve the mystery, but you can have some fun.</details>
      <p>What does the tapping on my foot mean?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. It has something to do with the blackjack game.</details>

        <details><summary>D.</summary>3. Who did you help earlier in the story?</details>

      <p>Why won&#039;t the second dealer let me bet at blackjack?</p>

      <p>Then how do I tame Nimrod? Or is it Elsie?</p>

        <details><summary>B.</summary>lion, to gain its trust? Don&#039;t bother.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>2. The guard refers to Nimrod as &quot;he.&quot;</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>3. Nimrod, being male, is the shaggy lion; while Elsie, being female, is</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>the smooth-bodied lion.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>4. Harry indicates that Elsie must be whipped three times to be brought</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>under heel.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>5. Now, if you&#039;re holding the stool, you can successfully open the grating</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>while keeping the shaggy Nimrod at bay.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>6. Of course, the lump of meat needs to be in the barred passage to lure</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>the lions in there.</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>7. And you have to leave the lions&#039; den before Nimrod and Elsie take the</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>bait and leave their den.</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>8. Parenthetically, it&#039;s prudent to CLOSE THE GRATING in order to secure</details>

      <p>Is there anything important about Mahler&#039;s cage?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Did you LOOK UNDER THE CAGE?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. If you were a nasty, or one of a group of nasties, who had kidnapped a</details>

        <details><summary>F.</summary>3. Then again, if this group of nasties saw you snooping around, wouldn&#039;t</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>they move her to a safer hiding place?</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>4. Of course, they might drop something in the process.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>5. Look in your game package for something with a red ribbon on it.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>6. This must be the little girl&#039;s red ribbon. TAKE IT! It&#039;s evidence!</details>

        <details><summary>L.</summary>How can I look into the compartment? I can&#039;t find an opening.</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>1. The simplest explanation is often the most correct.</details>

        <details><summary>O.</summary>3. LOOK UNDER THE STRAW.</details>
      <p>How can I calm Mahler down?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Have you any idea why the ape is named Mahler?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. There&#039;s a clue in your circus program in the WPDL advertisement.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. &quot;Music soothes the savage beast.&quot;</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>4. Perhaps classical music would soothe this savage beast.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>5. If you haven&#039;t yet gotten the radio from Tina, don&#039;t read further.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>6. Have you examined the headphones, found in the cage north of Menagerie</details>

        <details><summary>J.</summary>8. And PLAY the tape for Mahler to listen to in his cage.</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>9. Be sure to record a long enough stretch of music -- apes are dangerous</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>to be around when they are disappointed...</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>10. And apes get disappointed when whatever is soothing them stops, such as</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>when a violin concerto by Vivaldi is interrupted by a Jimi Hendrix</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>guitar solo.</details>
      <p>Why is the ape named Mahler?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Someone on the circus lot is a lot more chatty than the other</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>performers. Perhaps he can tell you about Mahler.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>2. ASK HARRY ABOUT MAHLER.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>3. Mahler, the man, was a classical Austrian composer in the nineteenth</details>

<!-- The Egress -->
  <h2 id="the_egress">The Egress</h2>
      <p>What IS an egress?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Egress is another word for &quot;exit.&quot;</details>
      <p>Why can&#039;t I go see the egress?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. You can if you answer the questions right, so to speak.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. If you answer &quot;yes&quot; to &quot;Are you sure you&#039;re mentally prepared...?&quot; the</details>

        <details><summary>G.</summary>beast.&quot;</details>

        <details><summary>I.</summary>the egress is an animal,&quot; the response asks if you really want to exit.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>5. If you answer &quot;Yes,&quot; you exit -- the game, that is. It&#039;s as if you had</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>died, and been given a chance to RESTORE, RESTART, or QUIT.</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>6. If you answer &quot;No,&quot; that you don&#039;t want to leave, you don&#039;t. That</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>simple.</details>
      <p>Is this joke original?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Hate as we do to admit it, no, game writer Jeff O&#039;Neill did not invent</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>the &quot;This Way To The Egress&quot; idea.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>2. P. T. Barnum himself made it up. Faced with the problem of too many</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>people crowding his Midway shows, he erected this banner to lure</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>unsuspecting victims out of the circus. Not only did he clear the</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Midway, he made more money from the resale of tickets to those suckers</details>

  <h2 id="the_monkey">The Monkey</h2>
      <p>Help! I&#039;ve got a monkey on my back! 1. You and the detective both. Call A.A. 2. Oh, it&#039;s a real monkey! Why didn&#039;t you say so? 3. Why don&#039;t you try to appeal to his base, animal instincts. 4. Food seems to be a precious commodity around here. You could try to lure him off with some food. 5. When you&#039;ve gotten some food, come back to this monkey puzzle. Don&#039;t worry, the monkey&#039;s not going anywhere. 6. So, you&#039;ve bought a banana. Did you ever stop to wonder why the monkey doesn&#039;t seem to notice this simian staple in your hands? 7. Perhaps the chocolate coating on the banana is throwing him off the scent. 8. If you take a bite, the pasty fruit center will be exposed. 9. Ah, the beast&#039;s heart quickens, you say? Now to lure him off your back with the bait. 10. DROP THE BANANA or THROW THE BANANA will send the little chimp after it and release you from your burden.</p>
<!-- The Hen -->
  <h2 id="the_hen">The Hen</h2>
      <p>How can I catch the hen without hurting it?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Hens like to sit on eggs.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. What looks like an egg?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. Have you looked inside the Lions&#039; Den? Inside the lions&#039; mouths?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>4. Stick your head in the shaggy lion&#039;s mouth as far as you can. There</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>might be something in there that looks like an egg. Or a tooth.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>5. Then again, there might not be.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>6. You CAN&#039;T catch the hen. There is no hen.</details>

<!-- The Mouse -->
  <h2 id="the_mouse">The Mouse</h2>
      <p>How do I catch a mouse?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. First, you find a mousetrap.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. Most mice are very timid, so you&#039;ll have to drop the trap somewhere and</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>leave it for a while.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>3. If you thought there were mice in your basement, would you put a</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>mousetrap in your attic? Of course not!</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>4. PUT THE CHEESE IN THE TRAP, then SET THE TRAP, then DROP THE TRAP in</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>the Prop Tent, then EXIT.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>5. When you return, you will hear a faint scurrying...</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>6. If you leave the tent again, the mouse will return to eat in peace.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>7. When you come back, the mouse will rest in peace.</details>
      <p>How can I catch the mouse without hurting it?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Only read this if you&#039;ve tried using the mousetrap.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. The poor mouse cashes in his chips, gives up the ghost, or (shall we</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>say) kicks the bucket if you use the mousetrap.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>3. If you leave the cheese in the trap but don&#039;t set it, when you return</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>the second time to the Prop Tent...</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>4. ...the mouse gnaws timidly away at the cheese, until you interrupt it.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>Now that you&#039;re in the same room with the live mouse, all you have to</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>do is figure out some way to capture it alive.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>5. There was a hint back there in #2!</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>6. You can trap the mouse in a container.</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>7. Use the bucket, which is inside the cage north of Menagerie Nook.</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>8. CATCH THE MOUSE IN THE BUCKET. Just make sure not to have anything else</details>

      <p>How can I rescue Chelsea?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Don&#039;t go any further unless you&#039;ve heard a muffled scream.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. If you&#039;ve only found the suitcase, then you can&#039;t rescue her yet. Don&#039;t</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>continue until you&#039;ve found Chelsea again.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>3. If you&#039;ve found the crawl space, then continue.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>4. Gee, it&#039;s a pretty small crawl space.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>5. I guess only a pretty small person could fit through it.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>6. This is a job for Comrade Thumb!</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>7. PUT THUMB IN THE CRAWL SPACE.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>8. WAIT. Thumb will do the rescuing for you, but he&#039;ll need your help.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>9. TAKE CHELSEA when she appears in the opening.</details>
      <p>Where can I find Thumb?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. He usually hangs out in Clown Alley.</details>
      <p>How can I get into Clown Alley again?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. EXAMINE THE DOOR.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. Looks like you need something to pry open the door.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. If you haven&#039;t been to Katz&#039;s trailer, don&#039;t bother to continue.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>4. The crowbar looks like a good fit for the warped door.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>5. OPEN THE DOOR WITH THE CROWBAR then enter Clown Alley.</details>
