      <p>How can I get to the office before Veronica?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Have you tried...</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>...following her?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>...going out the French Doors and around the house?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>...going out the Back Porch and around the house?</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>...going out the sliding glass doors, through the garden, and southwest</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>from the covered walkway?</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>If you have tried all these, you know that you can&#039;t get to the office</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>before Veronica.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>Anyway, it wouldn&#039;t be much of a game without her murder.</details>
      <p>What should I do with Veronica?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Have you tried to resuscitate her?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>It&#039;s too late for Veronica. Call the police.</details>
      <p>Why is the Detective so unobservant?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The Detective is supposed to mimic your performance in DEADLINE(tm) and</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>The WITNESS(tm), and we all know how well you did on those, don&#039;t we?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Well, if the Detective were too good, there wouldn&#039;t be much of a role</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>for you, would there?</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>The Detective will do very few things without being prompted by you.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>The police examine a few places on their own and, after they are done,</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>they retire to the Ballroom to consider what (if anything) they&#039;ve</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>learned.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>The Detective will perform analyses for you if you ask, and will make</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>some helpful comments about the evidence you produce. Of course, if you</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>suggest that an arrest be made, the police will usually jump at the</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>chance.</details>
      <p>What should I do with any evidence I find?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Have you tried showing any to the other guests?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Show the evidence to the Detective and Sergeant Duffy.</details>
      <p>How did the thief get into the house?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Have you tried opening any of the windows?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>A family as rich as the Ashcrofts surely must have a sophisticated</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>alarm system.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Was anything stolen?</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>If you remove Veronica&#039;s body from the office and return there before</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Michael and his friends arrive, you&#039;ll learn that nothing was stolen.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>Who started that rumor anyway?</details>
      <p>Is the fairy mask important?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It is an integral part of the Fairy Costume.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>There&#039;s a clue in it; have you examined it inside and out?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>&quot;Caught in the silver mesh...&quot;</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Is it Veronica&#039;s hair?</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Use the verb COMPARE.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Hmmm.</details>
      <p>Where can I find the business card?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It&#039;s in the waste basket.</details>
      <p>What does the business card mean?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Cochrane wanted to stop Veronica from doing something.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>It is related to the agreement in the manila folder.</details>
      <p>What can I learn from the Purchase and Sale Agreement?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Veronica was planning on selling the estate to Ostmann.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>She sure was prevented, wasn&#039;t she?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Have you asked Michael about Ostmann?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Show the agreement to Ostmann after he finds out about the murder; he&#039;s</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>got an interesting piece of news.</details>
      <p>What is the significance of the silver bullet?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>If you haven&#039;t seen a bullet, why did you develop this answer?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Have you looked at your gunbelt?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Have you really looked at your gunbelt?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Did you take it off first, so you could see the back?</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Someone must be trying to frame you!</details>
      <p>What is the significance of the hair?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Compare it to someone else&#039;s hair.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Particularly Alicia&#039;s.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Don&#039;t you find it odd that a hair similar to Alicia&#039;s would be in</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Veronica&#039;s costume?</details>
      <p>Who is the guest whose coat Smythe gets tangled in?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Have you accounted for everyone?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Have you ever seen the guest again?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Have you ever tried looking at him during the confusion?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Have some sympathy for the poor fellow!</details>
      <p>Does the rain amount to anything significant?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It&#039;s been raining heavily all day. Several inches must have fallen.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>The way it comes down is more important.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>It&#039;s been pouring most of the time...</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>...but for a while it was only drizzling.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Something else happens during that time.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Alicia arrives soaking wet.</details>
      <p>How do I get past the dog?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Remember, he&#039;s never met you before.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>He&#039;s a watchdog, so he doesn&#039;t trust strangers.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>You might try kicking him.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Oops, just kidding.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Be friendly, not threatening.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Try to pet him a few times.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>Actually, no matter what you do (besides retreat), the dog will hold</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>you up for 5 moves.</details>
      <p>What about the footprint?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>If you haven&#039;t...</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>...been outside, stop here.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>...looked at the pumpkins, stop here.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>...tried to jump into the pond, stop here.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>...gotten into the barn, stop here.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>...found the muddy boots, stop here.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>...analyzed the mud from the boots, stop here.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>...shown the analysis of the mud to Senator Asher, stop here.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>Senator Asher wore the boots as he snuck out to the pond to meet Linda,</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>and got them muddy. But, while taking them off, he saw Ellen</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>approaching with the lead pipe, so he hid in the Barn. Janet was hiding</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>there, too, after leaving the insurance policy under a bale of hay.</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>Some mud from the boots got on her costume.</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>What a pile of rubbish! If you believe that, there&#039;s a slightly used</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>bridge you might be interested in....</details>
      <p>What is a Brewster?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>If you haven&#039;t...</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>...found the body yet, stop here.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>...been in the Morning Room yet, stop here.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>...opened the window seat yet, stop here.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>...put the body in the window seat yet, stop here.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>...ever seen &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace,&quot; stop here.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>If you don&#039;t remember what a Brewster is now, go see the movie again.</details>
      <p>What can I do with the broken glass?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You could take it and, when the police arrive, have it analyzed.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Or you could have it fingerprinted.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Of course, you&#039;ll smudge any fingerprints on it if you take it.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>If you leave it alone, Smythe will clean it up and throw it away in the</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>kitchen.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Send the Detective to the kitchen to examine the glass.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>If Muhammad won&#039;t go to the mountain...</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>Take the trash basket to the Detective, then ask that the glass be</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>fingerprinted.</details>
      <p>What do the various costumes mentioned in the Ballroom mean?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The man in the square plastic mask is wearing an old SUSPENDED(tm)</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>package.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>The six-foot tall invisible rabbit is Harvey, the pooka.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>The others are even more obscure.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Actually, that&#039;s a lie.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>The three blind mice aren&#039;t too obscure.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>Enough! You&#039;ll run out of developer ink!</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>Persistent, aren&#039;t you?</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>You know, it&#039;s people like you who make the authors&#039; job worthwhile. As</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>a reward for your perseverance, the next answer is going to reveal who</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>committed the murder.</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>Suzanne did it.</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>Another lie. Actually, the authors own stock in a developing marker</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>company, and this is just a ploy to make you use more fluid.</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>Joanne did it.</details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary>That&#039;s also a lie.</details>
        <details><summary>Q.</summary>Next quarter&#039;s dividend is gonna knock your socks off.</details>
        <details><summary>R.</summary>Maybe the authors will buy a yacht.</details>
      <p>Where is the master bedroom?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It&#039;s upstairs.</details>
      <p>Where is the safe?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Probably behind a picture somewhere.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>There are portraits in the living room...</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>...and more in the master bedroom.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Look behind the Van Gogh.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Maybe it was the Rembrandt.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Just kidding, it was the Warhol in the master bathroom.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>Why even bother?</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>Did you develop the answers regarding the costumes in the ballroom?</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>The yacht idea is sounding better all the time.</details>
      <p>How do I get upstairs?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>All of the known ways are roped off.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Did you find the ladder in the barn?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Put the ladder against the house. It&#039;ll reach up to the second floor.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>What ladder?</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>What master bedroom?</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Sorry. Just kidding. You can&#039;t go upstairs.</details>
      <p>Is there anything important in the east coat closet?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It&#039;s full of &quot;rather damp coats.&quot;</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>One is more than just damp.</details>
      <p>Is there anything helpful in the Library?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Have you searched the room thoroughly?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>The chair may prove to be helpful.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>An important transaction takes place in the Library.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Have you tried hiding behind the chair?</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Once you&#039;ve hidden, wait to see what will happen.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>If you hide after 10:45 p.m., it may be too late. Try again.</details>
      <p>Where are the torn pages?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Have you shown the book to the Detective?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>The Detective doesn&#039;t seem to be concerned.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Search the office; papers are strewn all over there.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Sorry, but that will have to remain a mystery.</details>
      <p>What can I do in the dining room?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Have you looked in the china cabinet?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>You can go east into the kitchen...</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>...or go south into the long hall.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Do you remember the beginning...</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>...of this booklet? Do not assume that the presence or absence of a</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>certain topic is an indication of its importance. Also, don&#039;t assume</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>that long answers are associated with important questions. Just like</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>this one.</details>
      <p>What is burning in the fireplace?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Logs, most likely.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>At one point, though, there is something else burning.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Only for a few minutes though.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Marston throws it in there.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>It&#039;s a piece of evidence he wants destroyed.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>You can&#039;t get the paper from Marston directly. Wait by the fireplace</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>until Marston tosses it in, then type TAKE THE PAPER.</details>
      <p>What is the significance of the list?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It &quot;has one corner torn from it where it was stapled to something.&quot;</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>It indicates that Michael and Marston were equal partners in Southeast</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Planning.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>But, until you find what the list had been attached to, you won&#039;t find</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>out the significance of that Corporation.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>&gt;&gt;This space intentionally left blank.&lt;&lt;</details>
      <p>Where can I find the origin of the list?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Backtrack from when Marston threw the list in the fireplace.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Marston had just come from a meeting with Michael...</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>...and Michael had just come from the garage.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Look in the garage.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>There are three places it can be: in the cars or in the toolbox.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>What you are looking for is in the trunk of the BMW 320i.</details>
      <p>How did Sergeant Duffy get to Maryland, anyway?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>What do you mean? Hasn&#039;t he always been there?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Oh, you mean: &quot;He was in Connecticut a few years ago, in DEADLINE, so</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>what&#039;s he doing in Maryland now?&quot;</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>What makes you think it&#039;s the same Duffy?</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Maybe the one in Connecticut is this one&#039;s twin brother.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Sergeant Francis Xavier Duffy of the Montgomery County Police is</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>related to Sergeant John Aloysius Duffy of the Lakeville, Connecticut</details>

      <p>What is Michael doing in the garage?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Mourning?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>You won&#039;t find out if you arrive after he does.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Hide behind a car before he arrives.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>You should investigate this further.</details>
      <p>Where are the pumpkins that I read about in the Maryland Rambler?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Just where they were dumped.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>So find them yourself.</details>
      <p>What can I do with the toolbox?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Have you looked in it?</details>

      <p>WELLMAN AND BARRON CONVICTED IN ASHCROFT MURDER</p>
      <p>ROCKVILLE, March 8. Michael Wellman and Alicia Barron were convicted today of the first degree murder of Wellman&#039;s wife, Veronica Ashcroft. The jury deliberated for less than one hour before reaching its verdict. Colonel Robert Marston, head of the Ashcroft family trust, had already been convicted in a related case of embezzlement. Appearing before Judge N. S. Galley, District County Attorney John Castle summarized the case for prosecution: &quot;Michael Wellman was already up to his neck in deception. He was involved with Col. Marston in the embezzlement of the Ashcroft Trust and in a love affair with his wife&#039;s so-called &#039;best friend,&#039; Alicia Barron. When Veronica suggested a move up-county that would necessitate a significant drain on the Trust&#039;s funds, and possibly reveal Southeast Planning&#039;s thefts, Michael began to think of murder. When an accidental peek into a carelessly unlocked file cabinet revealed that Veronica knew of the thefts, he put his plan into motion. &quot;Michael consulted with Col. Marston, whose reaction was to flee until the murderer convinced him he could placate Veronica and retrieve the evidence. It is only because all involved agree that Marston was not directly a part of the plot that he too was not indicted as an accessory. &quot;Capitalizing on Alicia Barron&#039;s resemblance to Veronica in size and shape, Michael and his accomplice maneuvered Veronica into selecting a masquerade costume that completely obscured her face and head. A casual friend of the victim&#039;s, a reporter for the Washington Representative, was selected to &#039;take the rap.&#039; &quot;On the night of the party, Alicia secretly arrived early, and using one of Michael&#039;s keys, hid in the locked office. When the reporter arrived in a costume that included a lariat, Michael switched his intended method of murder to further implicate the hapless reporter. &quot;After Veronica had been seen by the party guests, Michael lured her away to the office, where she was murdered. Michael retrieved the incriminating folder to be hidden elsewhere. Alicia donned Veronica&#039;s costume over her own flimsy one and returned with Michael to the Ballroom. &quot;After a few minutes of boozy socializing as &#039;Veronica,&#039; Alicia contrived an accident to her costume and left the Ballroom. She rushed to the office, redressed Veronica in the costume, and left through the back door to &#039;just arrive&#039; at the front one. &quot;It only remained for Michael to stay in the Ballroom, establishing his alibi, and to wait for the body to be discovered. Then he could dispose of the folder and fulfill his bargain with Marston by turning over the investor list with Marston&#039;s name on it.&quot;</p>

      <p>SOCIALITES KILLED, FRIEND ARRESTED IN BIZARRE LOVE TRIANGLE</p>
      <p>RAPPANOC, November 1. Prominent hunt country socialite Veronica Ashcroft was murdered and her husband was killed last night during their annual Halloween Costume Ball. A friend of the family, Alicia Barron, is being held in the Rappanoc Women&#039;s Correctional Facility in connection with the deaths. Witnesses reported Ms. Ashcroft, dressed as a fairy queen, left the main area of the party after staining her gown and later was discovered in her office strangled with a lariat. Initially the Representative&#039;s reporter, who was covering the event, was suspected in the murder as the murder weapon was a lariat that was part of the reporter&#039;s costume. Astute detective work by our reporter allayed these suspicions, and pointed to a frame-up. The plucky reporter went on to prove it was Veronica&#039;s own husband and her self-described &quot;best friend&quot; who were guilty. When the pair were confronted with the damning evidence, they fled to the barn in an effort to escape. Ironically, Michael was trampled and killed by Veronica&#039;s prize horse &quot;Lurking Grue&quot; as he and Barron entered the barn without any light. Barron was arrested and held without bail.</p>

      <p>REPORTER FOILS POLICE INVESTIGATION, SUSPECT STILL AT LARGE</p>
      <p>RAPPANOC, November 1. The murder investigation of hunt country socialite Veronica Ashcroft-Wellman was foiled last night by a Representative reporter. As a result, two suspects, Michael Wellman and Alicia Barron, escaped. Wellman was later found dead, apparently trampled to death by Ms. Ashcroft&#039;s horse, &quot;Lurking Grue.&quot; Barron&#039;s whereabouts are still unknown. The reporter allegedly confronted the two with evidence believed to identify them as the murderers rather than turning the evidence over to the police. A get-away car, previously parked behind the barn by Barron, was used for her escape. Wellman was killed when he entered the horse barn without any light, causing the horse to panic. &quot;I have never experienced such a flagrant act of egoism before,&quot; declared the Detective. &quot;The reporter deliberately interfered with my investigation, withheld evidence, and caused this aberration of justice.&quot;</p>
