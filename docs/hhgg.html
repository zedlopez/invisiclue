        You shouldn&#39;t develop anything in this section until you&#39;ve finished the<br>
        game. Things in the section will invariably give away the answers to puzzles<br>
        in the game.<br>
        <br>
        Have you tried...<br>
        <br>
          looking under your bed?<br>
          enjoying the mud while you&#39;re lying in front of the bulldozer?<br>
          to PHONE HOME from your bedroom?<br>
          asking Prosser for the time?<br>
          to GET DRUNK in the pub?<br>
          buying peanuts (as Arthur)?<br>
          listening to the jukebox music (several times, then again when you&#39;re<br>
            Ford)?<br>
          petting or kicking the dog?<br>
          feeding peanuts to the dog? (You can only do this as Ford, of course.)<br>
          hitting Prosser (before and after your house is demolished)?<br>
          enjoying your house after it&#39;s been demolished?<br>
          asking PROSSER, WHAT ABOUT MY HOME after it&#39;s been demolished?<br>
          giving the towel, the thing your aunt gave you, or the satchel to Prosser?<br>
            (You can only do the last one when you&#39;re Ford, of course.)<br>
          talking to Prosser after the Vogon fleet has arrived?<br>
          eating the cheese sandwich when you&#39;re Ford?<br>
          going straight to the Pub when you&#39;re Ford, instead of giving Arthur the<br>
            towel, and then waiting a few turns?<br>
          yelling in the Dark?<br>
          waiting about 60 turns in Dark to see the hints you get?<br>
          not eating the peanuts in the Vogon Hold?<br>
          drinking the Santraginean Mineral Water?<br>
          asking FORD, WHAT ABOUT THE EARTH once it&#39;s been destroyed?<br>
          developing the invisible printing in this booklet with a mixture of<br>
            shampoo and apple cider instead of the developing marker?<br>
          (Doesn&#39;t work very well, does it?)<br>
          enjoying the Vogon poetry without the babel fish?<br>
          opening the hatch in the Heart of Gold before landing on Magrathea?<br>
          kicking the screening door, then entering Marvin&#39;s Pantry?<br>
          closing the screening door once you&#39;ve opened it?<br>
          reading the tiny message on the circuit board with the magnifying glass?<br>
          smashing the circuit board?<br>
          turning on the spare Drive, plugged into the control panel, before the<br>
            missile attack begins?<br>
          turning on the spare Drive during the missile attack, without first<br>
            plugging it into the control panel?<br>
          asking Eddie to open the hatch after the ship has landed?<br>
          not going to the Access Space after asking Marvin to fix the hatch?<br>
          saying something other than your name when the Beast asks for it?<br>
          saying your name with the towel over your eyes?<br>

          carving one of the names suggested by the previous item?<br>
          carving the Beast&#39;s name on the memorial?<br>

          waking the sleeping Beast?<br>
          drinking the wine at the party?<br>
          eating one of the hors d&#39;oeuvres? (Try several times.)<br>

          to PICK UP ARTHUR or PICK UP PHIL at the party?<br>
          jumping into the water from the Presidential Speedboat?<br>
          throwing something into the water from the boat?<br>
          shooting the crowd, the guards, Trillian, yourself, the toolbox...<br>
          ordering GUARDS, SHOOT both before and after they&#39;ve dropped their photon<br>
            rifles?<br>
          examining the approaching star system and the third planet from the War<br>
            Chamber of the battle fleet?<br>
          talking to the Vl&#39;Hurg leader or G&#39;Gugvunt leader?<br>
          dropping something in the Maze (your brain) and then walking around once<br>
            you&#39;ve gotten out?<br>
          talking to the bulldozer driver, the Vogon Captain, or the hostess?<br>
          closing the thing your aunt gave you?<br>
          wrapping the towel around your head anywhere except Traal?<br>
          typing I AM ARTHUR DENT to the game (as opposed to while talking to a<br>
            character in the game)?<br>
          typing PANIC? How about DON&#39;T PANIC?<br>
          pushing the red button on the Thumb when an Engineer robot is already<br>
            present?<br>
          counting the hors d&#39;oeuvres, the crowd at the Dais, or the guards (at<br>
            various points)?<br>
          typing DON&#39;T LOOK or DON&#39;T WAIT or DON&#39;T (anything else)?<br>
          examining the bulldozer, the Vogon fleet, the flowerpot, the mechanism in<br>

            returning to Traal after getting the Interface...)<br>
          typing APPLAUD at any point (other than during the poetry reading)?<br>
          answering the game&#39;s various rhetorical questions, such as &quot;Did you have a<br>
            particular direction in mind?&quot; or &quot;Don&#39;t you think it would be a bad<br>
            idea to leave the ceremonies?&quot;, by typing YES or NO?<br>
          typing APPRECIATE [something]?<br>
          asking various characters about the object of the game? (Especially<br>
            Prosser, Ford, Marvin, Eddie, the Nutrimat, the screening door, and the<br>
            Beast.)<br>
          calling Infocom&#39;s Technical Hotline and trying to convince them that<br>
            you&#39;re Winston Churchill?<br>

      <div class="indented">
      <p>
        The section tells how to find the place where each footnote is referenced in the game. Once again, you shouldn&#39;t develop this section until you finished, because it will probably ruin some puzzles for you.</p><p>
