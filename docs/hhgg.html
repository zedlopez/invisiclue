        You shouldn&#39;t develop anything in this section until you&#39;ve finished the<br>
        game. Things in the section will invariably give away the answers to puzzles<br>
        in the game.<br>

          talking to Prosser after the Vogon fleet has arrived?<br>
          eating the cheese sandwich when you&#39;re Ford?<br>
          going straight to the Pub when you&#39;re Ford, instead of giving Arthur the<br>
            towel, and then waiting a few turns?<br>

          closing the thing your aunt gave you?<br>
          wrapping the towel around your head anywhere except Traal?<br>

          answering the game&#39;s various rhetorical questions, such as &quot;Did you have a<br>
            particular direction in mind?&quot; or &quot;Don&#39;t you think it would be a bad<br>
