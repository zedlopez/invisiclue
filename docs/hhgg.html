  <h2 id="in_the_dark">In the Dark</h2>
      <p>Help! I&#039;m in the Dark and can&#039;t do anything! If this &quot;Dark&quot; is at the very beginning of the game, before you&#039;ve done anything, you&#039;re in the wrong place. Look at the first question in the first section of this booklet. You&#039;ve been through a matter transference beam, and you still haven&#039;t recovered from the shock of it. Recovery takes time... ...but in this case, you&#039;ll have to do more than just wait.</p>

  <h2 id="general_questions">General Questions</h2>
      <p>Is there any significance to &quot;no tea&quot;?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Yes.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>It&#039;s a hint that at some point, getting tea will be important.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Also, see the question about the screening door in the Corridor, Aft</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>End in the Heart of Gold section.</details>
      <p>What the Zark is the thing my aunt gave me which I don&#039;t know what it is?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Have you tried examining it?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Have you tried getting rid of it?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>You&#039;ve probably noticed that it keeps turning up.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>If you leave it behind, it will pop up about a dozen moves later,</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>sometimes on the ground where you are, sometimes in your inventory, and</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>sometimes in your gown pocket. (The thing will only &quot;follow&quot; you when</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>you are Arthur.)</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>There&#039;s something else that you probably haven&#039;t noticed about the</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>thing your aunt gave you.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>You can put things in it. In fact, you can put almost every takeable</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>item into the thing at the same time.</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>This is useful for transporting more objects than you carry [sic], but</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>it isn&#039;t ever necessary to do so.</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>Because of these two properties (auto-return and containment) the thing</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>your aunt gave you provides an alternate solution of one of the puzzles</details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary>in the game.</details>
        <details><summary>Q.</summary>It&#039;s a puzzle toward the very end of the game.</details>
        <details><summary>R.</summary>It&#039;s the puzzle of getting the flowerpot out of the whale.</details>
      <p>Is the Hitchhiker&#039;s Guide important?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Well, the game _is_ named after it...</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>The various entries in the Guide contain all sorts of useful</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>information and hints that you&#039;ll need to solve the puzzles in the</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>game.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>The proper syntax for reading a particular Guide entry is CONSULT GUIDE</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>ABOUT (item). For example, you could type CONSULT GUIDE ABOUT</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>MUSHROOMS.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>Once you know the solutions to all the puzzles, you could play to the</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>end of the game without ever using the Guide.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>There are 39 Guide entries in the game. A complete list of the topics</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>appears in the Guide Entries section.</details>
      <p>What is the Thumb? How does it work? Is it important?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The Thumb is an electronic Sub-Etha Auto-Hitching Device. If used</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>properly, it will allow you to hitch rides aboard passing spaceships.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>You should read the Guide entry on the Thumb.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>You can examine the Thumb to determine whether a spaceship is within</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>range. (If the lights are flashing, a ship is nearby.)</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>If a ship is within range, you can transport yourself to the ship (via</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>a matter transference beam) by pushing the green button.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>If you press the green button when there is no ship around, you&#039;ll</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>break the Thumb.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>Also, the Thumb will break down on its own over the course of the game.</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>If the Thumb is broken, you will not be transported when you press the</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>green button, even if a ship is nearby.</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>A broken Thumb can be mended.</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>To do so, push the red button to summon a repair robot. See the</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>following question for further details on repairing the Thumb.</details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary>There are three points in the game when you can use the Thumb.</details>
        <details><summary>Q.</summary>The first time is near the very beginning of the game, when you use it</details>
        <details><summary>R.</summary>to get to the Vogon ship.</details>
        <details><summary>S.</summary>The second time is when you&#039;re in the Airlock of the Vogon ship. It</details>
        <details><summary>T.</summary>isn&#039;t necessary to use the Thumb here, because simply waiting a few</details>
        <details><summary>U.</summary>turns has the same result.</details>
        <details><summary>V.</summary>The third time is when you&#039;re Inside the Sperm Whale. Once again,</details>
        <details><summary>W.</summary>there&#039;s an alternative to using the Thumb, but in this case it&#039;s not as</details>
        <details><summary>X.</summary>simple as just waiting. See the section entitled &quot;Inside the Whale&quot; for</details>
        <details><summary>Y.</summary>more information.</details>
      <p>Is the Engineer robot important?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Only the Engineer robot can fix the Thumb.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Once you&#039;ve summoned the Engineer robot, SHOW (or GIVE) THE THUMB TO</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>THE ENGINEER ROBOT.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>If the robot claims that there&#039;s nothing wrong with the Thumb, then it</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>wasn&#039;t broken.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>If the Thumb is broken, the Engineer robot won&#039;t agree to fix it unless</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>you also SHOW THE GUARANTEE TO THE ENGINEER ROBOT.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>Actually, you can shortcut by showing the guarantee first.</details>
      <p>What&#039;s all this nonsense about fluff?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>There does seem to be a lot of it scattered throughout the game.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Have you consulted the Guide about fluff?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>The ancient legend is of particular interest.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>There are a total of four pieces of fluff in the game. You&#039;ll have to</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>find and obtain all four.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Try finding them yourself. When you&#039;re stumped, return to this</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>question.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>Hint: You have four different roles over the course of the game:</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>Arthur, Ford, Trillian, and Zaphod.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>You can obtain one piece of fluff during each role.</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>A list of all four, and their locations, follows. You shouldn&#039;t look at</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>this list unless you&#039;re completely stumped, because it will give away a</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>lot.</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>Pocket fluff: in the pocket of your gown at the start of the game.</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>Satchel fluff: inside Ford&#039;s satchel (see The Earth, Revisited). Jacket</details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary>fluff: on Arthur&#039;s jacket (see At The Party). Seat cushion fluff: under</details>
        <details><summary>Q.</summary>the pilot seat of the speedboat (see On Damogran)</details>
        <details><summary>R.</summary>Now that you have all four pieces of fluff, any idea what to do with</details>
        <details><summary>S.</summary>them?</details>
        <details><summary>T.</summary>Don&#039;t continue until you have the flowerpot.</details>
        <details><summary>U.</summary>You should plant each piece of fluff in the flowerpot.</details>
        <details><summary>V.</summary>Now wait.</details>
        <details><summary>W.</summary>A tiny plant will sprout around ten moves later.</details>
        <details><summary>X.</summary>For more information, see the next question.</details>
      <p>What do I do about the plant?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Left to itself, the tiny sprout will never grow any further.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>You have nothing to water the plant with.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Read the Guide entry on fluff again.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Notice that this rare plant once grew on a tropical world.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Can you think of anything around that&#039;s similar to a tropical</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>environment?</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>Carry the plant into the sauna.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>Now examine the plant.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>Now see the question about opening the hatch in the Heart of Gold</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>section.</details>
      <p>What are all these tools scattered throughout the game?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Have you examined them?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Many of them are rather excitingly high-tech, aren&#039;t they?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>They don&#039;t really have much use...</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>...until the very end of the game.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>See the question about opening the hatch in the Heart of Gold section.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Marvin will ask for one of ten different tools.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>A list of all ten, and their locations, follows. You shouldn&#039;t look at</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>this list unless you&#039;re completely stumped, because it will give away a</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>lot.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>Flathead screwdriver: in your Bedroom. Toothbrush: in your Bedroom.</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>Tweezers: inside Trillian&#039;s handbag. Molecular hyperwave pincer: on the</details>

      <p>What is the goal of the game?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Have you tried asking some of the other characters in the story?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Have fun, be happy.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Solve all the puzzles, reach the end.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>The ultimate goal of the game is to step out onto the surface of</details>

        <details><summary>F.</summary>Knowing this fact is of virtually no help in getting through the game.</details>
      <p>How can I read the footnotes?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You obviously didn&#039;t read your manual very carefully. That&#039;s explained</details>
