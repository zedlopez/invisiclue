      <p>Where am I?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Wherever you go, there you are.</details>
      <p>How can I get the ichor in the flytrap?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You can&#039;t.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>It&#039;s a lure to trap people and insects.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Good thing you got away in time.</details>
      <p>Who is the boy?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>He blows bubbles.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>BIG bubbles. After all, he&#039;s a BIG boy (physically, not emotionally).</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Don&#039;t annoy him too much. He&#039;s bigger than you now.</details>
      <p>How can I get the bubble-blowing equipment from the boy?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You can&#039;t.</details>
      <p>What&#039;s a pergola?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It&#039;s a framework for supporting climbing plants.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>You can climb it, too.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Watch out, it twists and turns in more ways than you might expect.</details>
      <p>Who is Felix Klein?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>He was a German mathematician who described a solid with only one</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>surface, essentially a three-dimensional version of the Mobius strip.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>This construct is commonly referred to as a Klein bottle.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>If you don&#039;t know what a Mobius strip is, you can look it up in an</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>encyclopedia.</details>
      <p>Everything is backwards! What happened?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>If by backwards you mean east is west and left is right then ...</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>... you flipped the universe (changed its handedness) by your actions.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Specifically, by your movement.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>You moved through the pergola loop, which is really a Klein bottle.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>(See previous question for details.)</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Every time you completely move around the pergola loop, everything</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>outside changes handedness.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>This is mostly confusing, but it also comes in handy.</details>
      <p>Where can I find a light source?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>See anything that glows besides the lump?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Anything phosphorescent?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>The log glows.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>It also disintegrates into an easily carried splinter.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>My candle won&#039;t stay lit!</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>That&#039;s what you get for using cheap candles.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>There are no candles in this story, cheap or otherwise.</details>
      <p>How can I get to the mesa?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The tree nearby would be useful if you could cross the chasm on a</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>branch.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>But you can&#039;t climb the tree.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Maybe you can build a bridge.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Chop down the tree with the axe.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Don&#039;t forget to push the tree in the direction you want it to fall in.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>CHOP THE OAK TREE WITH THE AXE. PUSH THE TREE NORTH.</details>
      <p>I need a cutting tool. Where&#039;s the nearest hardware store?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>There are no hardware stores in this story.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>But there are a couple of cutting tools.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>One of them is hidden in a dark place.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>You&#039;ll need a light to find it.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>There&#039;s a silver axe at the top of the pergola.</details>
      <p>Who is &quot;Wabewalker&quot;?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Keep playing. The answer will dawn on you.</details>
      <p>How do I open the crypt?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You have to move the heavy lid.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Aristotle said he could lift the world with a long-enough lever.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Use something that&#039;s sturdy enough not to break.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>What you need is inside one of the mushrooms.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>OPEN THE CRYPT WITH THE SPADE.</details>
      <p>An iron door is blocking the tunnel! How do I get out of the barrow?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>First you have to get past the barrow wight to the north.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>There&#039;s some significance to the hole in the wall.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>It&#039;s a keyhole.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>There&#039;s a key that opens all kinds of locks.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>A skeleton key.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>See any skeletons around?</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>In the Ossuary, perhaps?</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>SEARCH THE BONES.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>When you get the key it will fit in the hole; turning it will open a</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>secret way out of the barrow.</details>
      <p>How do I stop the barrow wight from killing me?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Barrow wights don&#039;t like light.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>As long as you have a working light source, he&#039;ll leave you alone and</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>let you pass him.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>And don&#039;t forget that!</details>
      <p>How can I carry water?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Water would be easy to carry if it weren&#039;t a liquid that spilled all</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>over the place.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>You can&#039;t carry water. Not in its liquid state, anyway.</details>
      <p>How can I get the lump of metal?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You need to cool off the lump first.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>You can&#039;t use water, since you have nothing to carry liquids in.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Use frozen water.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Use an icicle.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Great, big icicles are hanging in the Ice Cave behind the waterfall.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Unfortunately, the melting icicle will slip out of your grasp before</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>you can carry it to the lump...</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>...unless you stop the icicle from melting too quickly.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>Maybe you can refreeze the icicle. There are some places that are cold</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>enough to do this.</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>High altitudes are cold.</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>You can refreeze the icicle at the Vertex.</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>Take the icicle to the Vertex on the way to the lump. From the Ice</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>Cave go E. E. E. U. U. The icicle will refreeze. D. D. NE. E. E. will</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>get you to the crater in time to PUT THE ICICLE ON THE LUMP. (Note: you</details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary>might have to go W &amp; NW instead of E &amp; NE.)</details>
      <p>The icicles are out of reach! How do I get one?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Try solving this problem the way you solved another problem.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Throw something at the icicles. One (and only one) will fall for you.</details>
      <p>What is the significance of the giant book?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It&#039;s a book of records.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>It records every move you make.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>&quot;Curiouser and curiouser.&quot;</details>
      <p>What is the liquid in the cauldron?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It&#039;s a boiling potion, magically heated.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Maybe you can drink the potion.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>You shold finish brewing it first.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>There&#039;s a formula around here somewhere.</details>
      <p>What is the magpie babbling about?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Magpies just repeat what they hear.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>When it&#039;s not repeating you, it&#039;s repeating something else it&#039;s heard.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Maybe what is has to say is important. You should listen to it.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Hmm. Sounds like a recipe.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>A recipe for a magic spell!</details>
      <p>Where can I find some milk?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>There are no animals around to provide milk.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>However, you can get milk from other sources.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>The source of milk is inside one of the mushrooms.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>The coconut on the tropical island is a source of milk.</details>
      <p>How do I milk a grue?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Very carefully.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>There are no grues in this story.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>But there are plenty of grues in _Wishbringer_(R), our best-selling</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>introductory fantasy which _inCider_ magazine called &quot;beautiful and</details>

        <details><summary>G.</summary>registered trademark of Infocom, Inc._)</details>
      <p>I still don&#039;t have any milk. How do I get some?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The milk is inside the coconut.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>You have to find a way of opening the coconut.</details>

        <details><summary>D.</summary>All you have to do is be in the right place at the right time.</details>

        <details><summary>C.</summary>Too bad the shadow won&#039;t come around again until after the bomb</details>

      <p>How can I stop the shadow?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Have you been to the Vertex?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>There&#039;s a gnomon missing from the sundial.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>If you screw the gnomon from Kensington Gardens into the hole, a lever</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>will appear. Easier said than done.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Aristotle said he could lift the world with a long-enough lever. You</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>can stop the world with your lever!</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>The shadow stops moving when the lever is lowered. Or is it the sun</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>that stops?</details>
      <p>My threads clash. What do I do?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Get a better tailor.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Seriously, you need to reverse one set of threads.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Look around and see if you can make things reverse.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>The writing on the sculpture in the Arboretum will reverse.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>To do this, walk completely through the pergola. N. U. S. D.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>This switches the handedness of everything outside the pergola.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>If you carry the gnomon with you, it won&#039;t switch, and the hole at the</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>vertex will, allowing you to screw the gnomon into the hole.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>This will probably mess up your map, but you can fix that by going</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>through the pergola without the gnomon.</details>
      <p>How do I get the shadow to stop on the toadstools?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>If you don&#039;t know how to stop the shadow, look two questions earlier.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>There is an easy way and a hard way.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>The hard way is to lower the lever as the shadow moves across a symbol.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>The easy way is to use the ring. Lower the lever, stopping the shadow,</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>then turn the ring (and the sun along with it) so that the arrow on it</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>points to where you want the shadow to stop.</details>
