<!-- The Carousel Area -->
  <h2>The Carousel Area</h2>
      <p>What is the solution to the riddle?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The word &quot;tall&quot; is somewhat misleading from the usual point of view.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Something deep, from the bottom, appears tall.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>It is a well. Type:  ANSWER &quot;A WELL&quot;.  The key words are &quot;round&quot;,</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>&quot;tall&quot;, and &quot;draw&quot;.</details>
      <p>Is it possible to leave the carousel heading west?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Not until the carousel has been stopped.</details>
      <p>I&#039;m getting tired of the carousel; can it be stopped?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Yes.  The ZORK implementors do have some compassion.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>When you reach the point where a solution is possible, it should be</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>fairly obvious.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>It involves the buttons in the Machine Room.</details>
      <p>What do I do with the clay brick?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Be careful with it.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Burning it will make its use apparent.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>It&#039;s plastic explosive.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Using a fuse may give you time to leave the area before it explodes.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Try inserting the black string.</details>
      <p>How do I open the door in the Tiny Room?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Have you looked through the window?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Are the spheres useful for anything?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Have you looked into the red sphere?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>The door is locked from the inside.  The key is still in the lock.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>You can push the key out of the hole with the letter opener.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Try the old trick of slipping something under the door to catch the key.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>Try using the place mat.</details>
      <p>Is there a way to get past the ice in the Ice Room?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Yes.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Have you tried melting the glacier with anything?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>A large, portable source of heat might be useful.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>There is one nearby.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>You can lure the dragon into the Ice Room, thus solving two puzzles.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Have you noticed that if you attack or in some way annoy the dragon,</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>then leave the room, he follows you?</details>
      <p>Where do I find an Ice Pick?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>There is none.</details>
      <p>What is going on in the Topiary?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You&#039;re not going to let a few hedges scare you, are you?</details>
      <p>How do I catch the unicorn and get the golden key?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>&quot;The unicorn is a mythical beast.&quot;</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Only one of royal blood may approach a unicorn.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Rescue the Princess from the dragon and watch what she does.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Follow her.</details>
      <p>How do I enter the gazebo?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You will not enter the dragon&#039;s lair while he lives.</details>
      <p>How do I kill the dragon?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You are too puny to harm him directly.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Even bombs have no effect!</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Did you notice when you attack the dragon and leave, he follows you?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>You can use this technique to lure him to the Ice Room.</details>
      <p>Can I kiss the Princess?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Only when she&#039;s sleeping.  Don&#039;t try anything nasty.</details>
      <p>How do I open the door in the Guarded Room?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You will need a key to unlock it.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>You have probably seen the key.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>It is hanging from a red ribbon around the neck of the unicorn.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>You will also need to do something about the lizard doorkeeper.</details>
      <p>What do I do about the lizard doorkeeper?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It cannot be killed.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>It can be satisfied by a particular treasure.  When you find it, it</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>should be obvious.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>There is a box of rare candied insects at the bottom of a pool of water.</details>
      <p>How do I move the menhir?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Blasting will have no effect on it.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>You will not be able to get past the large menhir until you have</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>mastered the Wizard&#039;s power, which first requires solving most of the</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>other puzzles in the game.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>One way to move it is to use the wand to &quot;float&quot; it.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Another way is to ask the demon to move it for you.</details>
      <p>What do I do with the Grue Repellent?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Read the label.</details>
<!-- The Oddly Angled Room -->
  <h2 id="the_oddly_angled_room">The Oddly Angled Room</h2>
      <p>Does the club have any use?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Examine it.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>It is a baseball bat.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>It is a clue to the nature of this maze.</details>
      <p>How do I reignite the club?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>If you examine it, you&#039;ll notice that it was never ignited.</details>
      <p>What do the glowing diamonds signify?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Progress.  The brighter they glow, the closer you are to solving the</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>puzzle.</details>
      <p>How do I break the glassy substance?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It cannot be done with the club.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>You might try the bomb, but it won&#039;t get you anywhere.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>The solution to the problem of the Oddly Angled Room has nothing to do</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>with breaking walls.</details>
      <p>What is the signifigance of the convention of wizards?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You&#039;ve been fantasizing again.</details>
      <p>Why does my sword glow when I am at the bottom of the stairs?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You are one room away from a dangerous creature.</details>
      <p>What in the world do I do in the Oddly Angled Room?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>If you solve this without any help at all, my cap is off to you!</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>The maze was meant to confound maze mappers.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>There are nine rooms.  Almost all of the room connections are</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>probabilistic - sometimes they work and sometimes they don&#039;t. (If you</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>repeat any direction often enough, you&#039;ll travel through all the rooms.)</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Have you noticed all of the baseball clues:  the Babe Flathead bat,</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>&quot;You&#039;ll never get past first base at this rate...&quot;?</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>The glowing diamonds are baseball bases - the brighter they glow, the</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>further you&#039;ve progressed.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>Left-handed pitchers are sometimes called &quot;southpaws.&quot;</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>The solution is to walk in the directions of a standard baseball</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>diamond, starting from home plate (where the bat is):  southeast,</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>northeast, northwest, southwest.  (It is admittedly a very difficult</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>puzzle - apologies to non-American Zorkers).</details>
<!-- The Bank -->
  <h2 id="the_bank">The Bank</h2>
      <p>What is the curtain of light for?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Have you read the bank brochure?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Have you tried touching it?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Have you tried throwing anything at it?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Have you tried walking through it?</details>
      <p>How do I turn off the alarm system?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Are there any switches or electrical devices in the area?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Does the Wizard have any appropriate spells?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Unfortunately, the alarm system remains foolproof.  You must find</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>another way to remove treasures.</details>
      <p>How do I get out of the Small Room?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You came in through a door, didn&#039;t you?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Like most doors, the curtain door has two sides.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>The other side of the door may not be apparent.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Try walking through the south wall.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Once the curtain door has closed, the only way out is to give the Gnome</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>something valuable.  If you have nothing of value, you will be trapped</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>forever.</details>
      <p>How does carrying the portrait affect where I will end up?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Any association between items you are carrying and the room to which the</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>curtain door leads is purely coincidental.</details>
      <p>How many places can I get to from the Depository?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Seven, inlcuding four through the curtain.</details>
      <p>How do I get into the vault?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The curtain door leads to four locations.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>It is completely deterministic (i.e., non-random).</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>The location to which it leads is determined by the direction from</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>which you entered the Depository.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>If you enter from the east, you will be transported to the East Viewing</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Room; if you enter from the west, to the West Viewing Room.  If you</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>enter from the south (e.g., the Chairman&#039;s Office) you will be</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>transported to the Small Room.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>You can leave the Small Room by walking through the south wall (thus</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>entering the Depository from the North).</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>If you enter the Depository from the north, you will be transported to</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>the Vault.</details>
      <p>How do I get out of the Vault?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>How did you get out of the Small Room?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Try the north wall.</details>
<!-- Volcano Area -->
  <h2 id="volcano_area">Volcano Area</h2>
      <p>What are the basket and canvas for?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The canvas is attached to the basket, as is the receptacle.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>You can get into the basket.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>This is a deflated balloon.</details>
      <p>Once I&#039;ve determined what the basket and canvas are, how do I use them?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Once you inflate the balloon, you will find a card with instructions</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>for use.  These hints deal with inflation.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Not all balloons use hydrogen or helium.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Remember that hot air is less dense and therefore rises?</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Burn something (such as the newspaper) in the receptacle.</details>
      <p>How do I leave the top of the volcano without being killed?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You don&#039;t but isn&#039;t it a glorious death?</details>
      <p>Which of the three paths down to the valley is best?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Ask the scarecrow.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Beware of the lions and tigers and bears.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>I suppose you&#039;ll soon be skipping and singing, &quot;We&#039;re off to see the</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Wizard&quot;.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>If you haven&#039;t guessed by now, this is a nonsense question.</details>
      <p>What is the signifigance of the mines and smelter?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Have you tried processing ore?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Did you dig for the lode of mithril?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>I find it amazing that you got this far, since there are no mines or</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>smelters in Zork II.  Keep in mind the warning in the introduction:</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Do not use the presence or absence of a question on a certain topic</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>as an indication of what is important, and don&#039;t assume that long</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>answers indicate important questions.</details>
      <p>How do I extend the lava tube?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>This is not possible.</details>
      <p>What do I do about the gnome?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The volcano gnome appears only if you are stranded on a ledge.  He will</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>help you, but only for a fee.</details>
      <p>How can I translate the books?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>A Zorkish-to-English dictionary would be useful, wouldn&#039;t it?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>So, of course, there isn&#039;t one.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>You cannot translate them.</details>
      <p>How can I open or remove the rusty old box?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>It has an oblong hole chipped into it.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Nothing short of blasting will open it.  Someone seems to have done you</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>a favor by creating a hole in which to place the bomb.</details>
      <p>Who is M. Agrippa?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Didn&#039;t he design the Pantheon in Rome?</details>
