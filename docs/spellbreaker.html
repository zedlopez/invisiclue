  <h2>The Council Chamber</h2>
      <p>Why are the guildmasters so angry at me?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Listen and find out.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. They seem to think you and your fellow mages are responsible for the</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>deterioration of magic.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Who is this &quot;shadowy figure&quot; who turned all of the other guildmasters into</details>
      <p>amphibians?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. The &quot;shadowy figure&quot; left the cloud in Belwit Square when it teleported</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>away.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>2. The word &quot;shadowy&quot; is an indication of the figure&#039;s persona.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>3. You&#039;ll find out more about this &quot;shadowy figure&quot; as the story</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>progresses...</details>
      <p>Belwit Square is filled with orange smoke. How do I get rid of it?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. There are two ways you can do it.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. You can use a spell in your spell book that will do the trick.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. Try LESOCH.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>4. Or you can wait for the smoke to dissipate.</details>
      <p>How do I get into the storied Manse?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. The guard at the door seems remarkably surly, no?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. Actually, you can&#039;t get into the Manse.</details>
      <p>What&#039;s this cube I found?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. The story tells you that it&#039;s just a white featureless cube.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. Actually, it is completely featureless, but you can do more than use</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>your normal senses.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>3. JINDAK before you pick up the cube and you&#039;ll see one feature of the</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>cube.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>4. Then see the next question.</details>
      <p>How do I get out of Belwit Square to get to the rest of the story?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Have you examined all of the items you&#039;re carrying?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. Your spell book in particular.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. Did you notice anything that wasn&#039;t there before?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>4. The BLORPLE spell will &quot;explore an object&#039;s mystic connections.&quot;</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>5. If you haven&#039;t gotten the orange smoke in Belwit Square to dissipate</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>then don&#039;t continue developing this question.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>6. JINDAK may indicate an object of interest.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>7. CAST BLORPLE on some of your items and see what happens.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>8. One item in particular has lots of &quot;mystic connections&quot; that need to be</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>explored.</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>9. That item is the featureless cube that remains after the orange smoke</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>dissipates. BLORPLE THE FEATURELESS CUBE.</details>
<!-- The Packed Earth Room -->
  <h2 id="the_packed_earth_room">The Packed Earth Room</h2>
      <p>I just arrived in Packed Earth, and it&#039;s pitch black! What do I do?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. If you can&#039;t get light somehow, you&#039;re in big trouble!</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. FROTZ any item you&#039;re carrying, or yourself.</details>
      <p>I just arrived in Packed Earth; where did the cube go?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Actually, the cube didn&#039;t go anywhere.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. You are, in a magical sense, within the cube.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. Don&#039;t worry, you&#039;ll get it back when you leave the room.</details>
      <p>Why can&#039;t I force my way through the north exit?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Because it is a magic exit.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. It&#039;s very strong magic, so you need very special conditions to be able</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>to get through this exit.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>3. More on this later...</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>I went west from Packed Earth to get to Cave Entrance, but going east from</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>Cave Entrance doesn&#039;t get me back to Packed Earth. What happened? How do I</details>
      <p>get back to Packed Earth?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Packed Earth is a &quot;magic&quot; room. It is not connected to other rooms in a</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>physical way.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>2. To get back to Packed Earth, go there the same way you got there in the</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>first place.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>3. BLORPLE THE CUBE.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>I&#039;ve gotten past the ogre, but I can&#039;t take anything from his lair.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>1. You must have used GIRGOL to pass the ogre.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>2. Bad idea. Everything is frozen in place and the ogre kills you as soon</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>as the time stop wears off. There&#039;s another solution to the puzzle. See</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>the next question.</details>
      <p>How do I get past the ogre?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Have you listened to the sounds the ogre makes?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. Have you YOMINed the ogre?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. The ogre has a bad case of hay fever.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>4. If there was a drugstore nearby you could help the ogre out.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>5. But since there&#039;s no such thing in this story, you&#039;ll have to take</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>advantage of this weakness.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>6. Do you have anything that could aggravate his allergy?</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>7. If not, then you&#039;ll have to solve another puzzle first.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>8. What about the weed in the Meadow (south from the Soft Room)?</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>9. What? Shaking the weed at the ogre didn&#039;t affect the ogre very much?</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>Perhaps if the weed was bigger.</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>11. Must this one be spelled out for you?</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>11. THROCK the weed.</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>12. Make sure to plant the weed first, though.</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>13. PLANT THE WEED THEN THROCK IT (in Ogre Cave or at Cave Entrance).</details>
      <p>What is the significance of the box?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. JINDAK before you pick it up. It&#039;s magic.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. You can identify any cube by putting it into the box and looking at the</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>design that appears on the box.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>3. The box has another feature. More on this later if you can&#039;t figure it</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>out by then.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>Help! I have all these featureless white cubes and I&#039;m having trouble</details>
      <p>keeping them straight. What can I do?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. You can use the box to identify the cubes. See above.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. You probably could find a way to label the cubes.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. If you have the burin, you can WRITE &quot;WORD&quot; ON THE CUBE. From then on</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>you can refer to the &quot;word&quot; cube.</details>
      <p>What is the significance of the avalanche?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. It keeps people like you from reaching the hut at the top of the</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>mountain.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>2. It kills people not smart enough to get out of its way.</details>
      <p>How do I get to the small building at the top of the mountain?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. You can&#039;t go up without starting an avalanche...</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. ...but you don&#039;t have to die if the rocks are frozen in place.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. If you haven&#039;t found the GIRGOL scroll, don&#039;t continue developing clues</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>in this question.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>4. If you&#039;ve already used up the GIRGOL scroll in another place, you won&#039;t</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>be able to get up the mountain. Bad move.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>5. CAST GIRGOL.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>6. If you still can&#039;t go up, try casting GIRGOL when the rocks are more</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>spread out.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>7. Try starting an avalanche before casting GIRGOL.</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>8. Start the avalanche, then GIRGOL when the rocks form almost a</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>continuous curtain. Then go up.</details>
      <p>Where can I find some mountaineering equipment?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. If you haven&#039;t GIRGOLed the cliff, don&#039;t continue.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. There is no mountaineering equipment. There&#039;s a way to freeze the rocks</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>in place when they&#039;re not so jumbled. See the previous question.</details>
      <p>How do I start an avalanche at Cliff Top?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. You must be crazy!! Why would you want to do a thing like that???</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. Well, if you really want to, type MOVE A ROCK or PUSH A ROCK.</details>
      <p>Why won&#039;t the hermit let me take his cube?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>ASK THE HERMIT ABOUT THE CUBE.</details>
      <p>How do I get the hermit to give me the cube?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. You can&#039;t bribe the hermit with food or buy the cube from him with the</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>coin, so you&#039;ll have to find another way to get the hermit to let you</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>have the cube.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>2. Have you noticed how poorly built the hut is? It needs the cube as a</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>keystone to hold it up.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>3. You could fix up the hut a little.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>4. A spell could help here.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>5. If you haven&#039;t been to the roc&#039;s nest, you don&#039;t have that spell.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>6. If you&#039;ve found the CASKLY spell, now is the time to use it.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>7. CASKLY THE HUT THEN TAKE THE CUBE.</details>
      <p>What can I do to get by the serpent?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. The serpent is huge, and makes a complete loop (having swallowed its</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>own tail). It fills the corridor. You probably can&#039;t force or sneak</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>your way by it.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>2. If you haven&#039;t gotten past the ogre, don&#039;t go any further.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>3. You&#039;ll have to find a way to shrink the serpent.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>4. Have you found the LISKON spell yet?</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>5. LISKON THE SERPENT.</details>
      <p>What is the zipper?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Have you tried opening and closing it?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. Or JINDAKing it?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. The zipper is really a huge container...</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>4. ...which safely stores anything in a different dimension.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>5. It&#039;s bigger on the inside than on the outside.</details>
      <p>Is there anything else interesting about the zipper?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. It&#039;s hard to tell. It&#039;s dark inside the zipper.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. There are three ways to find out if anything&#039;s in there.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. Try putting a FROTZed item into the zipper for light, then looking.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>4. Or REACH INTO THE ZIPPER.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>5. Or CLIMB INTO THE ZIPPER THEN LOOK. You can fit.</details>
      <p>Why can&#039;t I go down through the muddy hole?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Well, the story tells you that &quot;you pull back&quot; when you realize that</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>there isn&#039;t solid ground down there.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>2. But, if you&#039;re persistent (or foolhardy)...</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>3. ...why not try going down again?</details>
      <p>How do I get down off a roc?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. You can&#039;t. You get down off a goose.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. You can&#039;t. Relax and enjoy the ride.</details>
      <p>How do I get the cube from In Roc Nest?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. The mother roc is very protective of her egg. You won&#039;t be able to get</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>near the cube while she&#039;s in the nest.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>2. There is a way to get to the roc&#039;s nest without being taken there by</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>the mother roc.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>3. If you haven&#039;t been to the Air Room, leave the nest and work on another</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>puzzle for now. Don&#039;t forget to take the stained scroll while you are</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>here; it&#039;s useful.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>4. Have you managed to get the magic carpet in the bazaar? If not, get it.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>5. You can fly to the roc&#039;s nest on the magic carpet.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>6. Is the mother roc still there? There&#039;s a time when you can get to the</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>roc&#039;s nest without the mother roc being home.</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>7. Have you been to the Guard Tower above the Dungeon? If not, don&#039;t</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>continue.</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>8. The speck on the horizon is the mother roc.</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>9. If you fly on the magic carpet to the roc&#039;s nest (four turns to the</details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary>west from the tower) the mother roc will be away from the nest,</details>
        <details><summary>Q.</summary>searching for food. Now&#039;s your chance to get the cube.</details>
      <p>Holy farmer&#039;s breakfast! The roc&#039;s egg hatched! What do I do???</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. This time, you&#039;re really outmatched. Don&#039;t fight the baby roc.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. All you can do is run away.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. You have one turn to get away, so if you don&#039;t have any means of</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>immediate escape, you might as well type KILL ME.</details>
      <p>How do I get out of the roc&#039;s nest?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. It&#039;s a long way down.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. You can BLORPLE out.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. You can fly back on your magic carpet, but only if you know the</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>location of the Guard Tower.</details>
<!-- The Temple -->

<!-- The Magic Room -->
  <h2 id="the_magic_room">The Magic Room</h2>
      <p>How do I get through the east exit?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. You can&#039;t unless you have all of the cubes in your possession (except</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>the cube you used to BLORPLE to this room.)</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>2. There are twelve cubes besides the Magic Room cube.</details>
      <p>How can I save the world?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. By winning the game.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. Stop the shadow from remaking the universe to its own liking.</details>
      <p>What is the significance of the hypercube?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. A hypercube (or tesseract) is the four-dimensional analogue of a cube.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. A hypercube has sixteen vertices. Your thirteen cubes and the shadow&#039;s</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>four make seventeen, enough to build a hypercube with one left over.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>3. This hypercube is a construct in which the relationships of the</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>elements represented by the cubes are used to reconstruct the universe.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>Why do I get frozen at the ending? I&#039;m not doing anything to deserve this.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>Your presence is threatening enough. The shadow isn&#039;t stupid; it&#039;s</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>taking precautions to prevent you from interfering.</details>
      <p>I get frozen at the end and I never thaw. How can I thaw?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. One of the cubes helps you thaw.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. If you have the Magic Cube in your possession you will thaw in five</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>turns.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Time runs out before I can do anything. Help!</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>1. If the shadow froze you a little earlier, you would thaw out earlier.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>2. Provoke the shadow before it decides on its own to freeze you. You will</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>thaw out that many moves sooner and have extra time.</details>
      <p>When can I do something without getting noticed and frozen?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Read the descriptions carefully.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. Once you are frozen, the shadow doesn&#039;t think you&#039;ll thaw until it is</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>too late to stop its plan.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>3. When you thaw, wait until the shadow ignores you before doing anything.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Don&#039;t do anything that might get its attention, or it&#039;ll just freeze</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>you again. Spells should work.</details>
      <p>Okay, now I have some time. What do I do?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. You have to cast a spell to stop the shadow.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. None of the spells you memorized from your spell book will help.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. You would be well off to have written something on the vellum scroll</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>that you found, and brought it along,</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>4. Though you could have written almost any spell, GIRGOL is the most</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>powerful one available, and GIRGOL will &quot;time stop&quot; the shadow.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>5. Timing is important.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>6. GIRGOL the shadow as it prepares to jump into the hypercube.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>7. Then rearrange the restructuring of the universe to thwart the shadow.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>8. You have to take the Magic Room cube out of the hypercube...</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>9. ...and put in something else, or the universe will be created around</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>nothing; in other words, destroyed.</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>10. Don&#039;t put in a magic item, or it won&#039;t change the structure of the</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>universe, and everything will return to as it was.</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>11. Put in a non-magical item. The favorite of Boston area college students</details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary>is the smoked fish.</details>
      <p>Why do I get the final ranking that I do at 600 points?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Because magic is no more.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. The profession of magician is no longer very useful. Perhaps as a</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>scientist you can pursue a rewarding career.</details>
      <p>Why isn&#039;t there an alternative ending?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The inevitable result of magicians wielding such unchecked power as</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>existed before the end of the story would be the creation of another</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>shadow. It too might be defeated, but eventually one would arise who</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>would be victorious over its original. The outcome of such a victory is</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>too terrible to contemplate.</details>
<!-- Stuff and Things -->
  <h2 id="stuff_and_things">Stuff and Things</h2>
      <p>What good is the burin?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Did you look at it?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. Try JINDAKing it.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. It&#039;s used to inscribe words or spells.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>4. Can you think of any things that might be easier to tell apart if they</details>

        <details><summary>H.</summary>6. It&#039;s also useful for writing new spell scrolls.</details>
      <p>What good is the gold box?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. You might try JINDAKing it.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. Notice how the decorations on the box change when a cube is placed</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>inside it.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>3. Have you noticed that most cube rooms have an exit that you can&#039;t use?</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>4. When you place a cube in the box, it opens the &quot;impassable&quot; exit in the</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>cube room for that cube.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>5. That exit then leads to the location of the box, as long as it&#039;s</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>sitting on the ground (not being carried or in a container).</details>
      <p>What good is the zipper?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Have you tried JINDAKing it?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. Have you tried opening it?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. Have you looked inside it once it&#039;s open?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>4. Have you reached inside it?</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>5. Have you gotten inside it?</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>6. The zipper is a gateway to another dimension, and it can contain an</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>amazingly large number of things, including yourself. It is also</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>watertight when zipped.</details>
      <p>What good is the brass lantern?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Have you filled it with oil?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. Have you rubbed it until it&#039;s shiny?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. Have you noticed that it doesn&#039;t exist?</details>
      <p>What good is the compass rose?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Have you tried JINDAKing it?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. Have you been west of the Changing Room? If not, stop here.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. Does the carving in the Carving Room look familiar?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>4. Perhaps the compass rose would fit in the carving.</details>

      <p>What good is the moldy book?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. It sure is moldy and disgusting, isn&#039;t it?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. Can you think of anything that might improve it?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. CASKLY the moldy book.</details>
      <p>What good is the wrought iron key?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. Have you tried unlocking anything with it?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. It&#039;s too bad that the oak cabinet is so deteriorated.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. Of course, it wasn&#039;t always.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>4. Oh dear, did the key blow up in your face? It didn&#039;t? Good, go on to</details>

        <details><summary>F.</summary>5. Congratulations.</details>

      <p>What good is the ogre&#039;s club?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. You could try attacking the ogre with it.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. You could try hitting the lava fragment with it.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. You could try examining your head, since there is no ogre&#039;s club!</details>
      <p>What good is the vellum scroll?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>1. A blank spell scroll is a fairly valuable object.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>2. But then, you&#039;re not hunting treasures, are you?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>3. You might try writing on it.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>4. You could copy a spell onto it. Of course, you have all your spells in</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>your spell book, don&#039;t you?</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>5. Well, there was one spell that you had only on a scroll. Too bad you</details>
