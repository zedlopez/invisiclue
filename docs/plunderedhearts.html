  <h2>The Ship</h2>
      <p>Good Gracious! What is this extremely improper scene at the very beginning?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You are asleep, dreaming this when the pirates attack.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>It&#039;s a preview of things to come.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>It&#039;s a sample of the writing style of _Plundered Hearts_.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Romance novels always have teasers of this sort.</details>
      <p>Pirates are attacking _Lafond Deux_! What can I do?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You don&#039;t need to do anything, actually, though you may like to whack</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>an occasional pirate over the head with something. Heroines always get</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>rescued from ticklish situations like this one.  Well, almost always.</details>
      <p>I&#039;m stuck in the Captain&#039;s Quarters! How can I escape?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>There are two ways to escape, actually. One to the fore and one abaft.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Have you looked behind the curtain?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>The cupboard isn&#039;t quite blocking the doorway.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>To go to the fore, type WALK FORWARD. If Captain Jamison is present, he</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>won&#039;t let you go, of course.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>To go aft, see the next question (&quot;How do I get on deck?&quot;).</details>
      <p>How do I get on deck?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The hatch is closed tight and the door is barred, so you&#039;ll have to</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>find some other way.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>You need to climb the rope ladder that appears when Jamison leaves the</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>ship.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>The window won&#039;t open, but there&#039;s another way to &quot;open&quot; it.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>THROW THE COFFER AT THE WINDOW.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>Having broken the window, you can&#039;t reach the ladder without getting on</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>the ledge first. SIT ON THE LEDGE.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>All you need do is TAKE THE LADDER. Then you&#039;ll have to climb it</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>quickly. You can&#039;t hang onto slimy hemp forever.</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>With practice, climbing this ladder becomes much easier. In fact,</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>after you&#039;ve done it once, a simple CLIMB UP and CLIMB DOWN will</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>suffice.</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>I can&#039;t climb the ladder! My skirts get in the way!</details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary>Climb on to the ledge again, remove your dress and start the process</details>
        <details><summary>Q.</summary>over. This is no time for modesty.</details>
        <details><summary>R.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>S.</summary>Immodest I must be to get on deck, but I cannot, so undressed, preserve my</details>
      <p>virtue from Jamison&#039;s lusty crew. How may I move around?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Is there some way to disguise your gender?</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Have you thoroughly examined the sleeping cupboard in the landing?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Opened it? Climbed into it? Examined the pile of clothes in it?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>If you wear the shirt and breeches as a disguise, the pirates won&#039;t</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>bother you.</details>
      <p>How can I prevent the ship from blowing up?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You need to get on deck first.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Did you notice, in the hold, the fuse burning towards the kegs of</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>gunpowder, behind the fence?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Since you can&#039;t get through the fence yourself, you have to discover</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>some way of putting the fuse out from a distance.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>The gap above the fence will help.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>You can throw things over the fence on to the burning end of the fuse.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>They just slide off, you say, leaving the fuse undoused? What best</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>fights fire?</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>Water! But since you can&#039;t move the water barrel from the deck, you&#039;ll</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>have to rip off some other solution.</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>Getting ragged thinking about this?</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>RIP THE FROCK to make a rag. Then SOAK THE RAG IN THE WATER.</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>Finally, THROW THE WET RAG AT THE FUSE.</details>
      <p>How can I stop the _Helena Louise_ from dashing on the rocks?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You need to get on deck first.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>You may have overheard Crulley committing some mischief on the deck</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>above the crew&#039;s quarters. That&#039;s the forecastle.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Have you gone north from the forecastle to the bowsprit?</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>One of the two anchor lines has been cut. The ship is drifting on the</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>tide.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>You&#039;ll have to lower another anchor. Know what a mooring winch is?</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>Examine the lever on the winch.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>To open the teeth on the winch, in order to release the main anchor,</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>RAISE THE LEVER.</details>
      <p>How can I rescue my father, trapped as I am aboard the _Helena Louise_?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>To escape the ship, you need to get on deck first.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Have you examined the pyramid of casks on the quarterdeck?</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>One of the casks is open ended.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>If you enter the cask, you will notice...</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>A fraying rope. Maybe if you just helped it along a little.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>There&#039;s a dagger in the Galley.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>ENTER THE CASK. CUT THE ROPE WITH THE DAGGER.</details>
      <p>I escape the ship but drift out to sea. How can I get ashore?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The tide is going out. Wait for the tide to change.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>While you&#039;re waiting for the tide to change, you might want to stop the</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>_Helena Louise_ from dashing against the reefs.</details>
      <p>Of what use is the skiff?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You never HAVE to use it, it is just there in case you want to go back</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>to the _Helena Louise_...</details>

<!-- The Mansion -->
  <h2 id="the_mansion">The Mansion</h2>
      <p>How can I get into the mansion?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>There are five routes into the house, two from the western side and one</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>from every other direction.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>The easterly entrance is approached from the Folly. See the question</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>about the slat in the folly for more information. (&quot;There is a loose</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>slat at the back of the folly. Is it important?&quot;)</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>One of the western entrances is from the Trade Entrance, into the</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>kitchen. See the next question for more information. (&quot;Who is this</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>woman who keeps throwing me out of the kitchen?&quot;)</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>Another is from the Clearing northeast of the Forest. The place with</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>the climbing vines.</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>When you climb the vine in the clearing, you&#039;ll find your way into an</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>upstairs room.</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>The northerly entrance is south from the Main Entrance. You&#039;ll need to</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>have gotten something from inside the house (entering by another route)</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>before you can successfully enter here, however.</details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary>The final entrance is through the doors between the veranda and the</details>
        <details><summary>Q.</summary>ballroom. You&#039;ll have to unlock and open them from inside the ballroom</details>
        <details><summary>R.</summary>first, however.</details>
        <details><summary>S.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>T.</summary>Who is this woman who keeps throwing me out of the kitchen? How can I make</details>
      <p>her stop?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Her name is Lucy, and she is a friend of your father&#039;s. You&#039;ll probably</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>want to talk to her.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Lucy hasn&#039;t time to chat with beggars (your dress is looking pretty</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>bedraggled without its hoops), or with fine ladies. Your boyish</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>disguise could encourage her to chat.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>Enter the kitchen wearing the shirt and breeches.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>Remember to take the garter when Lucy offers it to you. It might be</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>useful.</details>
      <p>There is a loose slat at the back of the folly. Is it important?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>If you MOVE THE SLAT, a hole will be formed.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>If you GO THROUGH THE HOLE, you&#039;ll find a back entrance into the</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>mansion.</details>
      <p>How do I get the pistols in the Parlour?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>You can&#039;t.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Really. You can&#039;t. So stop trying.</details>
<!-- The Ball -->
  <h2 id="the_ball">The Ball</h2>
      <p>I haven&#039;t been to a ball in so long! How can I get in?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Since the veranda doors are locked, you&#039;ll have to enter past the</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>butler in the foyer.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Of course, if you don&#039;t look like a guest, the butler won&#039;t even let</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>you in the house. You&#039;ll have to dress properly.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Enter the foyer wearing a ball gown.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>You&#039;ll also need an invitation to give to the butler.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>I don&#039;t have an invitation to the ball!</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>If you haven&#039;t found an invitation, you obviously did not examine the</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>coffer thoroughly before losing it to the sea. (Don&#039;t worry. This isn&#039;t</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>necessary to win the game.)</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>If you found the invitation, but left it aboard the _Helena Louise_,</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>you could climb into the skiff and row out to the ship, get the</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>invitation and then row back. This would work, but...</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>The butler will take other compensation for your loss of the</details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary>invitation.</details>
        <details><summary>Q.</summary>BRIBE THE BUTLER WITH THE BANKNOTE. No thug is above a little bribery.</details>
        <details><summary>R.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>S.</summary>I&#039;m Cinderella, with nothing to wear to the ball! Where&#039;s my fairy</details>
      <p>godmother?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>This is not a fairy tale! This is real life! (Well, as close to it as</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>romance and interactive fiction ever come.)</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Have you found the Clearing yet?</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>The Clearing is northeast of the forest. There are climbing vines</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>there.</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>If you climb up the vines, you can crawl into the second floor window.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>That which you seek is in that bedroom.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>Lafond is threatening to kill my father unless I dance with him. What shall</details>
      <p>I do?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Dance with Lafond.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Unless you&#039;ve already rescued your father, in which case you may try to</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>refuse him.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>But Lafond is not a man to toy with.</details>
<!-- Rescuing Papa -->
  <h2 id="rescuing_papa">Rescuing Papa</h2>
      <p>Jamison can&#039;t find Papa anywhere, nor can I. Where else should I look?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Jamison has a theory about where a dungeon might be. Dance with him to</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>find out.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>The Library is in the east wing of the house. Is there anything</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>suspicious in the Library?</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>Jean Lafond is depicted in the portrait in the Library in exactly the</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>same pose as he is on the banknote. Examine the banknote that came in</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>your game package for clues.</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>Notice what Lafond is carrying.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>Notice what Lafond is wearing.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>Notice what Lafond is doing. This must be done last. Voila!</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>Once you have done this you may simply CLOSE and OPEN THE PORTRAIT.</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>Lafond said he&#039;d send for me when he was ready. I&#039;ve been waiting around for</details>
      <p>hours and nothing has happened. What&#039;s taking so long?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Lafond is a busy man, with many things to take care of before he can</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>relax. You should fill the extra time he&#039;s allowing you with the</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>discovery and rescue of your father.</details>
      <p>What do I do to get by the crocodile?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>The object is to render the beast incapable of biting you.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>There are two ways, actually.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>One way involves the garter. Go to Clue H for that solution.</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>Another way involves the laudanum you found in the Crew&#039;s Quarters.</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>You&#039;ll have to feed the crocodile something that has been doped with</details>
        <details><summary>F.</summary>laudanum. Food would be best.</details>
        <details><summary>G.</summary>There&#039;s something edible (to crocodiles) in the bottom of the cask in</details>
        <details><summary>H.</summary>which you floated to shore.</details>
        <details><summary>I.</summary>SQUEEZE THE LAUDANUM ON THE PORK. FEED THE PORK TO THE CROCODILE.</details>
        <details><summary>J.</summary>The first clue for the alternate solution requires a brief foray into</details>
        <details><summary>K.</summary>zoology: Crocodiles, while able to snap a log in two with their jaws,</details>
        <details><summary>L.</summary>have weak muscles for opening those very same jaws. Thus, a strong man</details>
        <details><summary>M.</summary>is capable of holding their jaws shut with his bare hands.</details>
        <details><summary>N.</summary>Since you are neither a strong man nor able to sit around holding</details>
        <details><summary>O.</summary>closed the monster&#039;s mouth, you have to find something else able to</details>
        <details><summary>P.</summary>hold it shut for you.</details>
        <details><summary>Q.</summary>The garter is a likely candidate.</details>
        <details><summary>R.</summary>Throw something at the reptile to get it to snap shut its jaws, then</details>
        <details><summary>S.</summary>PUT THE GARTER ON THE CROCODILE.</details>
        <details><summary>T.</summary></details>
        <details><summary>U.</summary>Here&#039;s a locked cell and I have no key.</details>
        <details><summary>V.</summary>Have you thoroughly searched the whole dungeon area?</details>
        <details><summary>W.</summary>Have you been in the Guard&#039;s Cell?</details>
        <details><summary>X.</summary>The key is on the cot in the Guard&#039;s Cell.</details>
      <p>Robert&#039;s fallen into the quicksand! How can I save him?</p>
        <details><summary>A.</summary>Look around for a large branch.</details>
        <details><summary>B.</summary>Get the fallen branch in the forest.</details>
        <details><summary>C.</summary>Drop the branch into the quicksand for Robert to grab hold of...</details>
        <details><summary>D.</summary>But this probably won&#039;t work since there&#039;s no branch, no quicksand and</details>
        <details><summary>E.</summary>no Robert in this game.</details>

      <p>Oh no! I can&#039;t get past this crocodile again! In such situations, one should get some outside help. Cookie and the crew aboard Jamison&#039;s ship might provide some assistance. Signal the ship from an eastward-looking window. Wave the mirror in the moonbeam shining in the window of Lafond&#039;s room. The pirates will respond. If you&#039;ve lost the mirror, you can use the silver tray. If you lead Cookie to the crocodile, he&#039;ll take care of the beast for you.</p>

(Besides rape, pillage and plunder.) Apes do it, monkeys do it, even Tarzan of the Jungle. You do it, you... SWING ON THE ROPE. Untie the rope first.</p>
